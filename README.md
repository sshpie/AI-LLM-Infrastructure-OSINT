This repository is the  catalogue of how the modern AI and ML stack exposes itself to the public internet by default. A living archive of Shodan queries, population-scale surveys, per-instance case studies, methodology insights, IR hand-off packages, and disclosure outcomes.

It is the primary published record of the  survey program. The work is done. The surveys are published. The methodology is open. The toolchain that produced this work lives in its own repos and is linked under [ Toolchain](#-toolchain).

## The thesis under test

 is a research program, not a one-shot scan. The work has a falsifiable thesis, and every survey either strengthens or breaks it.

**Insight #76, auth-permissive cohort default.** A new generation of OSS AI/ML infrastructure platforms (vector databases, RAG knowledge-base engines, agent orchestrators, observability platforms, model gateways, LLM workflow builders) ships with auth-permissive defaults. Registration is open, the data layer requires no authentication, and configuration disclosure on public endpoints is the norm. Operators deploy these into production, including at universities, hospitals, national research institutes, and Fortune 500 enterprises, without re-configuring the defaults.

The thesis is platform-cohort dependent. Same-day measurements across the cohort:

| Platform | Class | Unauth rate |
|---|---|---:|
| Langfuse | observability | 88.9 % SIGNUP_OPEN |
| RAGFlow | RAG engine | 87.2 % REGISTER_OPEN |
| Arize Phoenix | observability | 74.5 % PROJECTS_UNAUTH |
| Flowise | workflow builder | 68.7 % CHATFLOWS_OPEN |
| ComfyUI | image-gen UI | 77.5 % (no auth concept at all) |
| Meilisearch | vector + search | 9.6 % (env var, doc-foregrounded) |
| Open WebUI | chat UI | 11.8 % |
| Dify | LLM app platform | 0.9 % |
| AnythingLLM | doc chat | 0 % (hardened-by-default) |
| Langfuse cloud-tier auth | observability | 0 % (forced) |

The cohort split is real. The same-day spread from 0 % to 88.9 % is the corollary that **shipping defaults are load-bearing**: operators inherit whatever the framework ships with, at population scale, regardless of operator skill.

Each new platform we survey either reproduces the cohort pattern or breaks it. Negative results (AnythingLLM at 0 %) are published as confirmation by contrapositive. The thesis can be falsified by finding a same-cohort platform that ships auth-closed and at population scale stays auth-closed.

The full program brief is at `research-program/PROGRAM.md`. The synthesis paper-in-progress is `case-studies/commercial/SYNTHESIS-2026-05.md`.

Survey extensions tracked as case studies (no dedicated query file): **Cat-34** (FastGPT), **Cat-46** (ComfyUI default-port population), **Cat-46b** (Meilisearch), **Cat-47** (Ray Dashboard).

Per-platform exposure-tier and survey-status data lives in [`categories/yield-classifier/categories.yaml`](categories/yield-classifier/categories.yaml); conceptual definitions for every class are in [`reference/category-taxonomy.md`](reference/category-taxonomy.md).

Every query is tagged with an exposure tier:

| Tier | Meaning |
|---|---|
| T1 | Unauthenticated by default. A hit is typically a live, interactive target. |
| T2 | Requires misconfiguration or has known auth-bypass CVEs. One extra probe confirms exposure. |
| T3 | Recon and fingerprint only. Use for inventory and pivoting. |

Supplementary query sets cover AI-eval / red-team, auth gateways, experiment tracking, model-serving registry, RAG frameworks, safety guardrail, service mesh, specialty data layers, voice / audio AI, workflow orchestration, Texas universities, and a Google-dorks supplement (`ghdb-google-dorks.md`).

## Methodology

The pipeline is documented and executable. Eight stages, in order:

```
Platform Intel -> Discover -> Active Banner -> Fingerprint -> Verify -> Attribute -> Classify -> Ledger -> Score -> Codify
```

The middle stage, Verify, is where the discipline lives. 18 of the first 21 codified insights are verification-stage failures or the rules that prevent them. The scan is the easy part; verification is what separates a candidate from a finding. At population scale, skipped verification fails in systematic, not random, ways, producing confident, reproducible, wrong numbers.

The restraint ethic governs every survey. Enumerate metadata, do not exfiltrate. Names ARE the finding. Sample payloads minimally only to confirm severity. The ratio of "what we did not do" to "what we did" is the methodology.

### Numbered insights (88 files, 01 through 89, gap at #48)

Each insight is a standalone markdown file derived from a specific survey or incident, citable independently. The index is at `methodology/README.md`.

Recent insights include:

- **#76** Auth-permissive cohort default (the central thesis above)
- **#77** Active-banner prefilter via the `scanner` stage (Shodan cache decay around 70 %)
- **#78** Shared deployment kit, operator-class exposure
- **#79** Aspirational name-field attribution hierarchy
- **#80** DMARC enforcement rate as funding-stage proxy
- **#81** Compose EHLO leak generalizes to a class of three MTAs
- **#82** Branded error bodies are the banner
- **#83** Lane-C per-operator OAuth, not marketplace
- **#84** Cloud wrapper blast-radius expansion
- **#85** Stub vs real-vendor discriminator in LiteLLM catalog
- **#86** The disclosure pipeline is itself attack surface
- **#87** Canary persistence as monitoring proxy
- **#88** Scrape topology as operator org chart
- **#89** Framework-level auth bypass on pprof

## Articles

`articles/` holds published-grade write-ups of headline findings:

| File | Topic |
|---|---|
| `medium-2026-06-08-changsha-deepfake-rig.md` | A complete turnkey deepfake-production pipeline running unauthenticated on a Chinese 8x A100 cluster |
| `shadowray-2-self-detect-2026-06-08.md` | Defender advisory: 5-signal IoC pattern for ShadowRay 2.0 attacker fleet on Ray Dashboard |
| `x-post-2026-06-08-hk-meilisearch-botnet.md` | X (Twitter) headline thread: 66-host Hong Kong SEO content-spam botnet, attributed entirely from Meilisearch index naming |

---

## Assessment hand-off packages

`assessments/` holds IR-grade hand-off packages, draft form, restraint-bounded, never sent without researcher review. One bundle per active campaign cross-reference.

| Bundle | Recipient | Subject |
|---|---|---|
| `comfyui-ghost-2026-06-08-handoff/` | Censys ARC | 3 likely-GHOST hosts extending the April 2026 cryptomining-botnet disclosure |
| `ray-shadowray-2026-06-08-handoff/` | Oligo Security + Anyscale | 463 likely-ShadowRay-2.0 attacker IPs + 5-signal metadata IoC pattern |
| `cat04/` | (research bundle) | Training-frameworks survey artifacts |

---

## Disclosures

`disclosures/` contains 134 published disclosure documents covering universities, vendors, healthcare organizations, defense contractors, government CERTs, and AI-platform maintainers. The portfolio is an intentional public record; individual disclosures are not enumerated in this README. The directory includes the disclosure schema (`SCHEMA.md`), templates, and `_rendered/` outputs.

A meta-finding about this portfolio is captured as Insight #86: the disclosure pipeline is itself attack surface, and the choices made in the disclosure-routing flow are themselves findings.

---

## Tools

`tools/` holds attack-surface research documents and Python scripts used in survey work. Notable entries:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `ollama-recon.py` | Enumerate, inject-test, cloud hunt across the Ollama population |
| `ollama-model-injection.md` | Unauthenticated `/api/create` injection (all Ollama versions) |

| `visor-report.py` | HTML report generator |
| `bypass-prompts.json` | System-prompt bypass corpus |
| `epoch_lookup.py` | Epoch AI timestamp lookup |

These are point-in-time research artifacts, not maintained attack tooling. The continuously-developed tools live in the  toolchain repos.

## Restraint discipline

Every survey and deep dive in this repository was conducted under the same explicit rules. They are not soft preferences; they are how the work is admissible at all.

- GET-only metadata reads. Never POST to job-submission, prompt-execution, or write endpoints.
- Names + counts + version strings + file names. Never read job bodies, model checkpoints, or operator content.
- No authentication attempts on any service. No credential testing. No CVE exploitation.
- Honeypot pre-filter on every survey (AS63949 Linode salt, protocol-strict probe shape, GreyNoise scanner classification).
- WHOIS-driven contact resolution for disclosure routing. Never slug-heuristic.
- Hard-disclosure floor: even when "stopping the malicious activity" is the obvious want, intervention on third-party hosts is unauthorized computer access regardless of intent. Hand-off to substrate providers, national CERTs, and tracker authors (Censys ARC, Oligo Security, others) is the legitimate channel.

The 463 likely-ShadowRay attacker IPs and the 2,423-hour-of-output Changsha deepfake rig were observed, not engaged.

## What this repo is not

This is not a scanner. It does not run queries, probe hosts, or maintain attack tooling. It is a published reference and data repository: query catalog, methodology insights, case studies, survey artifacts, IR hand-offs, and disclosure record.

The active scanning, fingerprinting, and verification is done by the toolchain repos linked above. The `tools/` PoC scripts are point-in-time research artifacts; the live tools live in their own repos.

---

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The bar:

- Queries must be verifiable. You have to have seen them return real results.
- Queries are tagged with an exposure tier (T1 / T2 / T3) and a Notes column where the query reveals something specific.
- New categories must map to a real, deployed AI/ML platform with a population worth tracking.
- New insights are numbered, derived from a specific survey or incident, and citable independently.
- Case studies follow the methodology pipeline and end with a toolchain-provenance block.
