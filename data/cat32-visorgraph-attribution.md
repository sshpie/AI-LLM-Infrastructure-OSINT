# Cat-32: VisorGraph Cert-Pivot & Operator Attribution
 | 2026-06-01

## Method

Seeds: 87 Envoy Admin + 100 Kong Admin API IPs from ips-gateways/.
VisorGraph passive run: 0 graph nodes (MaxIterations=50 cap; admin ports 8001/9901 are HTTP-only, no TLS cert to pivot from).
Fallback: operator hostname extraction from Shodan banners + targeted api.host() dossiers on 5 interesting hosts.

## ATTRIBUTION FINDINGS

### FINDING A — Thai National Institute of Emergency Medicine (NIEMS)

```
IP:        203.154.187.226
Hostname:  api-portal-idems.niems.go.th
Org:       Internet Thailand Company Limited
Country:   Thailand
Tags:      self-signed, devops
Platform:  Kong Admin API (:8001) — CONFIRMED UNAUTH
```

**Ports:**
- `:443` — Kong 2.7.2 proxy (TLS cert: default self-signed Kong cert, CN=localhost, O=Kong, ST=California — never rotated)
- `:8001` — Kong Admin API, version 2.7.2, banner confirmed 200 JSON response
- `:8004` — OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu
- `:10250` — Kubernetes kubelet (TLS, CN=`ippbx-01@1698120068`)
- `:80` — HTTP/2 binary (gRPC endpoint)

**Chain:**
Kong 2.7.2 is EOL (EOL since 2022, multiple patched CVEs in 2023-2024). Unauth Admin API
at :8001 → service/plugin config readable → RCE via pre-function plugin (CVE-2020-11710 chain
still applies to unpatched 2.7.2). Default self-signed cert on :443 confirms no TLS management
practice. Kubelet :10250 exposed (cert CN=`ippbx-01` — possible VoIP cluster node).

**Operator context:**
NIEMS = Thai Ministry of Public Health agency for emergency medicine protocol and research.
`idems` subdomain = IDEMS platform (Integrated Data and Emergency Management System, likely).
Government healthcare operator. Kong Admin API should never be internet-facing.

### FINDING B — Purdue University Research Computing (RCAC)

```
IP:        128.211.143.207
Hostname:  cms-h006.rcac.purdue.edu
Org:       Purdue University
Country:   United States
Tags:      devops
Platform:  Envoy Admin (:9901) — CONFIRMED UNAUTH
```

**Ports:**
- `:9901` — Envoy Admin, title "Envoy Admin", server: envoy — CONFIRMED
- `:6443` — k3s Kubernetes API server (returns 401 — auth enforced)
- `:10250` — Kubernetes kubelet (TLS, CN=`cms-h006.rcac.purdue.edu`)

**Chain:**
Purdue RCAC operates HPC/research computing clusters. `cms-h006` = likely Content Management
System or Cluster Management System node 6. k3s cluster (lightweight K8s). Envoy Admin :9901
unauth → GET /config_dump → all upstream cluster credentials (API keys, auth tokens for
downstream AI API calls if this node routes LLM traffic). k3s API :6443 requires auth.
Kubelet :10250 exposed — authenticated but if Envoy config contains service account tokens,
the chain extends.

**Operator context:**
Research university cluster. RCAC = Rosen Center for Advanced Computing. LLM inference
routing through k3s + Envoy is consistent with research compute use case. This is academic
infrastructure, not commercial — disclosure path is security@purdue.edu or RCAC sysadmins.

### FINDING C — WAIcore Ltd / khotlenko.ru (Full HashiCorp Stack)

```
IP:        193.233.134.97
Hostname:  instance50479.waicore.network + khotlenko.ru + *.khotlenko.ru
Org:       WAIcore Ltd
Country:   Germany
Tags:      devops, eol-product, database
Platform:  Envoy Admin (:9901) — CONFIRMED UNAUTH
CVEs:      CVE-2024-25117, CVE-2013-2220, CVE-2022-4900, CVE-2024-3566, CVE-2024-5458
```

**Ports:**
- `:9901` — Envoy Admin, confirmed
- `:80/:443` — Envoy proxy (server: envoy), TLS cert CN=khotlenko.ru
- `:4646` — HashiCorp Nomad (UI 200 OK, auth state unknown)
- `:5432` — PostgreSQL (banner: "fe_sendauth: no password supplied")
- `:8083/:8085` — Apache httpd (PHP/7.4.33 on :8085)
- `:8500` — HashiCorp Consul (agent banner: datacenter dc1, NodeName server1, primary DC)
- `:8503` — Consul HTTPS
- `:22` — OpenSSH 8.9p1

**Full SAN pivot from khotlenko.ru cert:**
consul.khotlenko.ru, nomad.khotlenko.ru, pgadmin.khotlenko.ru, wiki.khotlenko.ru,
draw.khotlenko.ru (all point to this IP — operator runs all services under personal domain)

**Chain:**
Operator is running a personal infrastructure stack on a WAIcore VPS (German cloud provider
specializing in AI workloads). Envoy Admin :9901 unauth → config_dump → all upstream API
keys wired into Envoy clusters. Consul :8500 appears unauth from banner (agent info exposed).
Nomad :4646 UI accessible. PostgreSQL :5432 banner indicates connection, auth state
unconfirmed. PHP/7.4.33 on :8085 is EOL (EOL since Nov 2022) — consistent with `eol-product`
Shodan tag. CVE-2024-25117 (PHP), CVE-2024-5458 (PHP) apply.

**Operator context:**
`khotlenko.ru` = Russian developer or researcher (RU ccTLD). Running Consul+Nomad suggests
microservices/orchestration workload. WAIcore is an AI-focused hosting provider — this is
almost certainly an AI workload Envoy proxy. The Envoy /config_dump would reveal the actual
LLM API keys being proxied.

## VisorGraph MaxIterations Gap

The installed visorgraph binary caps at MaxIterations=50 (hardcoded in engine/engine.go:58).
For a 187-seed passive run, this processes only ~50 unique hosts before halting with
queue_remaining=137. Flag `-max-iter` is not exposed in main.go.

Recommended fix: expose MaxIterations as a CLI flag in cmd/visorgraph/main.go:

```go
maxIter := flag.Int("max-iter", 50, "Maximum fixed-point iterations (increase for large seed sets)")
cfg.MaxIterations = *maxIter
```

This is a tooling gap, not a methodology failure — the cert-pivot pivot worked when
supplemented with targeted Shodan host dossiers.

---

## Methodology Notes

- VisorGraph passive mode produced 0 graph nodes because admin ports (8001/9901) are
  HTTP-only — no TLS cert to pivot from at those ports.
- Attribution chain: Shodan hostnames → operator domain → api.host() for full port map →
  TLS cert extraction → SAN pivot. Equivalent to manual VisorGraph.
- 3 high-value operators identified from 5 dossier pulls (60% yield).
- All attribution is from Shodan-indexed data. No active probing of operator hosts.
