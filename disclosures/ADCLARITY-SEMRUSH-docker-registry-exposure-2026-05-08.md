This is an unsolicited good-faith coordinated-disclosure notification under the  umbrella (CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364, ICSA-25-140-11). I'm reaching `security@semrush.com` because AdClarity does not publish a `security.txt` or VDP, and Semrush owns and operates the AdClarity platform since 2022.

---

## Executive Summary

A 15-node Docker Registry cluster hosted at GloboTech Communications (Montréal/Laval, Canada) is publicly reachable on port 5000 with no authentication. The registries are load-balanced across all 15 IPs and serve a single shared backend containing **100 AdClarity image repositories**. Any anonymous client can list the full catalog via `GET /v2/_catalog` and pull image manifests and layers.

The exposed repositories span AdClarity's full operational surface: AI/LLM inference pipelines, captcha-bypass infrastructure, browser automation workers, platform-specific ad extractors (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Meta), internal operations tooling, and content-delivery components. Image layers likely contain baked-in credentials (database connection strings, API keys, third-party service tokens) as is common in containerized deployments that predate secrets-management maturity.

---

## Finding. HIGH: Public Docker Registry (port 5000). No Authentication

**Affected hosts:**
```
67.43.236.154 – 67.43.236.158     (GloboTech Montréal)
67.43.236.170 – 67.43.236.174     (GloboTech Montréal)
173.209.62.194 – 173.209.62.198   (GloboTech Laval)
```

**Proof of exposure:**
```
$ curl -s http://67.43.236.154:5000/v2/
{}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Docker-Distribution-Api-Version: registry/2.0
Date: Fri, 08 May 2026 04:57:35 GMT

$ curl -s http://67.43.236.154:5000/v2/_catalog | python3 -c \
  "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(len(d['repositories']), 'repos')"
100 repos
```

All 15 IPs return `200 OK` on `GET /v2/` with `Docker-Distribution-Api-Version: registry/2.0`. The catalog is identical across all nodes. They share a backend registry behind a load balancer.

** scope discipline:** We enumerated the catalog via `GET /v2/_catalog` only. We did not pull image manifests, layer blobs, or extract any content from image layers. The catalog listing alone is sufficient proof of the exposure class. Impact assessment regarding baked-in secrets is based on industry-standard pattern recognition for containerized workloads.

---

## Impact

**Intellectual property / source code:** Image layers contain compiled Java `.jar` files and Python/Node source (visible from image names like `adclarity/database-mediator.jar`, `adclarity/display_downloader.jar`). An attacker pulling these layers obtains AdClarity's proprietary crawler architecture.

**Operational security:** The captcha-resolver and browser-manager stacks are operationally sensitive. Public access to these images enables adversaries to reverse-engineer bypasses, replicate infrastructure, or identify fingerprinting vectors AdClarity uses. Undermining the platform's competitive and technical moat.

**Credential exposure:** Industry-standard practice for containerized workloads built at this stack age (Java/JRE 11 era images) is to bake environment variables, including DB credentials, API keys, and third-party platform tokens, into image layers. We did not verify this, but your security team should treat every image as potentially containing live credentials until proven otherwise by layer inspection.

**Compliance:** Depending on what customer query data flows through LLM pipeline images (`llm-dc-backend`, `chatgpt-adex`), GDPR/CCPA obligations may apply to the exposure window.

---

## Recommendations

Immediate (within hours):
1. **Enable registry authentication.** Docker Registry HTTP API v2 supports `htpasswd` and token-based auth. Add an authentication middleware (or migrate behind an authenticated registry service like Artifact Registry, ECR, or Harbor) so anonymous catalog enumeration is impossible.
2. **Firewall port 5000 from the public internet.** If this cluster is intended for internal/CI use only, a firewall rule allowing only office/VPN CIDRs eliminates the attack surface entirely.

Within a few days:
3. **Audit image layers for baked-in secrets.** Use `docker history`, `dive`, or a secrets scanner (truffleHog, gitleaks) on each image to identify any credentials embedded in layers. Rotate any found.
4. **Review Shodan/Censys exposure timeline** to determine how long the registry has been indexed and assess whether unauthorized pulls occurred.

## Evidence Preservation

A complete evidence bundle is preserved locally with server-asserted `Date:` headers from every HTTP capture, SHA-256 manifest, and OpenTimestamps receipt anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain. The bundle is held privately pending your remediation; we are not publishing it. Available on request via secure channel.
