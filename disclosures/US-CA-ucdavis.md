I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

University of California, Davis has an Ollama instance with `Qwen3-Coder-Next` (48GB), `qwen3.5:122b-a10b` (75GB), and, notably, `moophlo/Qwen3.5-27B-Claude-4.6-Opus-Reasoning-Distilled-GGUF:latest`, a model distilled from Claude 4.6 Opus, all accessible without authentication.

## Findings

**F1, Claude-Distilled Model Exposed (HIGH):** `Qwen3.5-27B-Claude-4.6-Opus-Reasoning-Distilled` is a model trained on Claude 4.6 Opus outputs. Accessible to any internet caller, this represents a research artifact with embedded Anthropic model behaviors.

**F2, 75GB MoE Model Accessible (HIGH):** `qwen3.5:122b-a10b` (75GB) is a large mixture-of-experts reasoning model. Significant compute resource exposed.

**F3, Model Injection (HIGH):** All 4 models injectable via CVE-2025-63389.

**Why it matters**

An embedding model indicates an active RAG pipeline, documents loaded into your vector store are reachable via unauthenticated queries.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
