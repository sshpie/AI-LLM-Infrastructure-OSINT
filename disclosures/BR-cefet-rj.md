I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Brazil's CEFET/RJ (Federal Center for Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca) has an Ollama instance with 17 models, including custom Brazilian Portuguese fine-tunes and a 39GB DeepSeek-R1:70B local model. No authentication. Heavy emphasis on Portuguese-language AI research/coursework.

## Findings

### F1: Unauthenticated Inference Across 17 Models (HIGH)

All 17 models accessible without authentication. The 39GB DeepSeek-R1:70B requires significant GPU resources, free inference at CEFET/RJ's compute expense.

### F2: Custom Brazilian Portuguese AI Models Exposed (HIGH)

Three custom-namespace models indicate either student/faculty research projects or coursework deployments:
- `lukashabtoch/moirai-agent`, likely a student's "Moirai" agent project
- `lukashabtoch/plutotext-r3-emotional`, emotional text model (R3 = release 3)
- `mario:latest`, unnamed researcher's model

CVE-2025-63389 injection on these custom models would silently affect any student/researcher relying on their outputs.

The `RecognaNLP/chatbode:7b` model is the public Brazilian Portuguese ChatBode (from USP/UFSCar's RecognaNLP group), its system prompt confirms instructional/conversational use:

> "Você é assistente de IA chamado ChatBode... projetado para ser prestativo, honesto e inofensivo."

### F3: Pygmalion Roleplay Model Present (MEDIUM)

`mattw/pygmalion:latest` is a roleplay/character-chat model, unusual deployment on a federal educational institution server.

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run uncapped inference against your GPU at your compute cost, and inject malicious system prompts into any loaded model via CVE-2025-63389.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
