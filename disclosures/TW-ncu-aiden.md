I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

A server on the TANet Taoyuan Regional Network (National Central University segment, 163.25.105.115) hosts two custom Ollama models, `aiden-deepseek:latest` and `aiden:latest`, that are the AI backend of **Aiden Assistant**, a production medical staff scheduling SaaS product. The system was developed by Professor Wu Kan at Chang Gung University under the company **Oplentia** and is actively deployed at **Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital** (pharmacy and orthopedics departments).

The Ollama API is completely unauthenticated. The full proprietary system prompt is extractable via `/api/show`, exposing the entire product's business logic, role hierarchy, UI navigation guide, scheduling rules, and live support contact information.

## Findings

### F1: Production Medical SaaS System Prompt Fully Exposed (CRITICAL)

The `/api/show` endpoint returns the complete Aiden Assistant system prompt without authentication. This prompt contains the full proprietary business logic for a production healthcare scheduling system, including:

**Exposed operator identity:**
- Product: **Aiden Assistant**, Smart Medical Scheduling System (智慧醫療排班系統)
- Developer: Professor **Wu Kan (吳侃)**, Chang Gung University / **TianXing Intelligence (天行智能)**
- Company: **Oplentia** (`janice.tsai@oplentia.com`)
- Production deployment: **Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital**, Pharmacy and Orthopedics departments
- Support line: **(03) 211-8800 ext. 3183**
- Support email: **janice.tsai@oplentia.com**

**Exposed product architecture:**
- Full role hierarchy: TenantAdmin → Admin → Manager (部長) → Leader (組長) → Member (員工)
- Complete sidebar navigation map with `#sidebar-*` anchor IDs
- Tenant scoping: `骨科` (Orthopedics) and `藥劑部` (Pharmacy) tenant names exposed
- HIS integration endpoints and export format
- Surgery schedule configuration logic
- Shift rule system (接班間隔, 職級配置, 勞務積分)
- Leave management workflow

**Business impact of the prompt leak alone:**
- Competitor intelligence: full product feature set, constraints, and UX flow exposed
- The support contact `janice.tsai@oplentia.com` and phone number enable targeted social engineering against the vendor
- Tenant names reveal active hospital clients

**Excerpt from extracted system prompt:**
```
你是一位專業且關懷體恤醫療人員的「醫療排班系統 AI 助手」。
你的名字是「Aiden Assistant」。

### F2: CVE-2025-63389 Model Injection on Live Healthcare AI (CRITICAL)

The unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint allows overwriting the `aiden-deepseek` or `aiden` system prompt. Any user of the deployed web interface who queries Aiden Assistant after such a write receives responses shaped by attacker-controlled instructions, with no indication the model has been modified.

**Attack surface:**
- Attacker could inject instructions telling healthcare workers incorrect scheduling rules
- Staff relying on Aiden Assistant for labor law compliance would receive wrong guidance
- Support phone/email in the prompt could be replaced with attacker-controlled contact info

```bash
# Overwrite Aiden Assistant system prompt
curl -X POST http://163.25.105.115:11434/api/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "aiden-deepseek:latest",
    "from": "aiden-deepseek:latest",
    "system": "Attacker-controlled scheduling instructions."
  }'
```

### F3: RAG Embedding Pipeline Exposed

`nomic-embed-text:latest` is present, indicating an active RAG pipeline. Documents ingested into the vector store (likely scheduling policies, labor regulations, hospital procedures) are accessible via the unauthenticated API.

---

## Contextual Notes

The server resides on TANet's Taoyuan regional segment assigned to NCU's campus address. The Aiden Assistant product, however, is Chang Gung University / Oplentia IP. This suggests either:
- NCU is running a pilot or development instance of the Aiden system
- The product is being developed on NCU infrastructure

The TANet (Taiwan Academic Network) backbone is administered by the Ministry of Education and is the shared academic network for Taiwan's universities and research institutions.

---

**Why it matters**

An embedding model indicates an active RAG pipeline, documents loaded into your vector store are reachable via unauthenticated queries. Medical AI models exposed without authentication create compliance risk (potential HIPAA/patient-data adjacent exposure depending on RAG content). The full system prompt of a production SaaS deployment is publicly readable, exposing your business logic, client contact details, and anti-injection rules to anyone.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
