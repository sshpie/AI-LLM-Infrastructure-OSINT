I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) has four externally-accessible Ollama nodes on campus, including an NVIDIA DGX research server with 18 cloud proxy subscriptions (same subscription portfolio as POSTECH/Shiv Nadar/Hanoi) and a student machine with two abliterated QwQ-32B models alongside an embedding model for a RAG pipeline. All nodes injectable via CVE-2025-63389.

## Infrastructure

| Hostname | IP | Models | Cloud | Notes |
|----------|-----|--------|-------|-------|
| disco-dgx-spark.wireless.rit.edu | 129.21.25.95 | 25 | **18** | NVIDIA DGX GPU server |
| ragdepc.student.rit.edu | 129.21.149.97 | 4 | 0 | **Student machine, abliterated models + RAG** |
| 8N610008D0.ad.rit.edu | 129.21.220.95 | 10 | 1 (deepseek) | AD-joined workstation |
| cl5.wireless.rit.edu | 129.21.146.150 | 19 | 0 | Wireless client, llama2-uncensored |

## Node: disco-dgx-spark (DGX GPU Server: 18 cloud subscriptions)

Same 18-model cloud portfolio as POSTECH, Shiv Nadar, and Hanoi University:  
DeepSeek (v4-pro, v4-flash, v3.2), MiniMax (m2, m2.1, m2.5, m2.7), Kimi (k2.5, k2.6, k2-thinking), GLM (4.6, 4.7, 5, 5.1), Qwen (3.5, coder-next), Gemini (flash-preview), Nemotron.

Local models: qwen3.6:35b (22GB), qwen3.5:27b (16GB), qwen3-coder-next:latest (48GB), llama3.2:3b, smollm2:135m.

All 25 models injectable via CVE-2025-63389. 18 cloud subscriptions accessible through unauthenticated port.

## Node: ragdepc.student.rit.edu (STUDENT Machine: Abliterated + RAG)

| Model | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| qwq:latest | 14 GB | QwQ-32B reasoning model |
| qwq-uncensored:latest | 14 GB | **Abliterated QwQ, safety removed** |
| huihui_ai/qwq-abliterated:32b-Q3_K_M | 14 GB | **Abliterated QwQ, safety removed** |
| nomic-embed-text:latest | 0 GB | **Embedding, RAG pipeline** |

- Hostname prefix `ragdepc` suggests "RAG deep PC", student building a RAG system with abliterated reasoning models
- Two variants of abliterated QwQ-32B publicly accessible on student hardware
- Model injection via CVE-2025-63389 affects any RAG pipeline using these models

---

## Node: cl5.wireless.rit.edu (Wireless Client: uncensored model)

19 models including:
- `llama2-uncensored:7b`, uncensored Llama 2
- `gpt-oss:latest` (12GB), `glm-4.7-flash` (17GB), `lfm2.5-thinking`, `ShreyanGondaliya/s5:latest`
- Multiple qwen3.5 variants, deepseek-coder

---

## Findings

### F1: DGX GPU Server: 18 Cloud Subscriptions Exposed (CRITICAL)

Research-grade NVIDIA DGX server running Ollama with 18 cloud proxy subscriptions, publicly accessible without authentication.

### F2: Student Machine: Dual Abliterated Reasoning Models + RAG (HIGH)

Student's machine running two variants of QwQ-32B with safety fine-tuning removed, alongside an embedding model confirming a RAG pipeline. Both abliterated models and the RAG pipeline are publicly accessible without credentials.

### F3: Third Node: llama2-uncensored on Wireless Client (MEDIUM)

Wireless-connected laptop running `llama2-uncensored:7b` exposed on port 11434.

---

## Pattern Note

The DGX server's 18-model cloud proxy portfolio (DeepSeek + MiniMax + Kimi + GLM + Qwen + Gemini + Nemotron) appears identically at POSTECH (Korea), Shiv Nadar (India), Hanoi University (Vietnam), and now RIT. This suggests a **shared Ollama Connect subscription, demonstration account, or institutional license** distributed across multiple universities.

---

**Why it matters**

The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services. An embedding model indicates an active RAG pipeline, documents loaded into your vector store are reachable via unauthenticated queries.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
