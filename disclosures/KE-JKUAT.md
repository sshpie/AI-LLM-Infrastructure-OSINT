I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), Kenya, is running an Ollama instance on campus with a MiniMax cloud proxy subscription publicly accessible without authentication. One local model alongside the cloud proxy. No credential leak detected on this instance.

## Infrastructure

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| IP | 41.89.8.169 |
| rDNS |, (NXDOMAIN) |
| Org | Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (KENET) |
| Country | Kenya |
| Open ports | 11434 (Ollama, **public**) |

JKUAT connects to the internet via KENET (Kenya Education Network). The IP block (`41.89.8.x`) is assigned to JKUAT's main campus.

## Models

| Model | Size | Type |
|---|---|---|
| minimax-m2.7:cloud | 0 GB | ☁️ Cloud proxy, MiniMax API |
| llama3.2:3b | 1 GB | Local |

---

## Findings

**F1, Unauthenticated Ollama API (HIGH):** Port 11434 publicly accessible. No authentication on `/api/tags`, `/api/show`, or `/api/create`.  
**F2, Cloud Proxy Subscription Exposed (MEDIUM):** `minimax-m2.7:cloud` accessible to any internet caller. 401 returned without credential leak on this instance.  
**F3, Model Injection (HIGH):** Both models injectable via CVE-2025-63389 (no patch).

---

## Notes

The cloud proxy 401 response is routed through Google Frontend (Ollama Connect) and does not expose account credentials in the response body on this instance, unlike Hanoi, Armenian Academy, and Purdue NW where Docker container IDs leaked as usernames.

---

**Why it matters**

The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
