I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Keio University (Japan) server with 8 Ollama models including two DeepSeek cloud proxy subscriptions and a 122-billion-parameter Qwen3.5 MoE model. Raw Ollama port publicly accessible without authentication. Cloud proxies require a higher-tier subscription (returned upgrade prompt, no credential leak). Full model injection surface via CVE-2025-63389.

## Findings

### F1: Unauthenticated Ollama API (CRITICAL)

Port 11434 publicly accessible. All 8 models enumerable without credentials.

### F2: Dual DeepSeek Cloud Proxy Subscriptions (HIGH)

Two DeepSeek cloud proxy models registered. Subscription tier check returned:

```json
{
  "error": "this model requires a subscription, upgrade for access: https://ollama.com/upgrade",
  "ref": "684df060-4e09-4e03-a76d-c07d04eb77c9"
}
```

Cloud proxy models exist and are registered, quota drain is gated behind subscription tier, not external access control. A subscription-bearing Ollama account could call these directly.

### F3: 122B-Parameter Free Inference (HIGH)

Any actor can run inference on `qwen3.5:122b` (75GB) without authentication:

```bash
curl http://131.113.41.213:11434/api/generate \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3.5:122b","prompt":"...","stream":false}'
```

Free compute at operator's hardware expense.

### F4: Model Injection (CRITICAL)

All models injectable via CVE-2025-63389. Affects students/staff using the Open WebUI frontend at 131.113.37.67:3000.

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run inference against your cloud API subscription at your expense, this constitutes direct quota/billing theft. The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
