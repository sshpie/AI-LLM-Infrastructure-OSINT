**Severity:** CRITICAL

I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Virginia Tech has at least 4 Ollama-running IPs in Shodan; only `h80adf308.dhcp.vt.edu` (128.173.243.8) responds publicly. The DHCP hostname indicates a desktop or workstation on the campus DHCP pool rather than a dedicated server. 5 models, no cloud proxies.

## Infrastructure

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| IP | 128.173.243.8 |
| Hostname | h80adf308.dhcp.vt.edu |
| Organization | Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ. |
| Country | United States (Virginia) |
| Open ports | 11434 (Ollama, public) |

Additional VT IPs in Shodan (198.82.9.219, 198.82.11.101, 198.82.13.6) did not respond, likely firewalled or offline.

## Findings

### F1: Researcher Workstation Publicly Exposed (LOW)

DHCP hostname pattern (`h80adf308.dhcp.vt.edu`) indicates a laptop or desktop on campus DHCP. No cloud proxies, no credential leak. Standard unauthenticated Ollama exposure on a workstation.

### F2: CVE-2025-63389 Injectable (HIGH)

All models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`.

---

**Why it matters**

The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
