I'm an independent security researcher conducting good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella (CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364, ICSA-25-140-11). This is an unsolicited coordinated-disclosure resend.

**Note on previous attempt:** I sent this disclosure on 2026-05-04 to `security@vnu.edu.vn`; the address bounced with `550 5.1.1` user-unknown. Resending to `hostmaster@vnu.edu.vn` per the SOA RNAME record for `vnu.edu.vn`. Please forward to the appropriate IT-security team. Apologies for the noise.
