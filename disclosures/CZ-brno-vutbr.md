I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Brno University of Technology (VUT Brno), Czech Republic, is running Ollama on a Faculty of Mechanical Engineering server with an abliterated Gemma 3 model (safety fine-tuning removed), two variants of a Bulgarian-language GPT model, and an embedding model indicating an active RAG pipeline. All models are unauthenticated and injectable.

## Findings

**F1, Abliterated Gemma 3 27B (HIGH):** `seamon67/Gemma3-Abliterated` has safety fine-tuning removed. Accessible to any unauthenticated internet caller on a university research server.

**F2, RAG Pipeline Injection Surface (HIGH):** `nomic-embed-text` embedding model confirms an active RAG pipeline. CVE-2025-63389 injection affects document-augmented responses.

**F3, Bulgarian Language Models (MEDIUM):** `todorov/bggpt` is a Bulgarian-language GPT, suggests international research collaboration or researcher with Bulgarian connections. Both variants are publicly accessible.

**F4, Unauthenticated Ollama API (HIGH):** All 8 models injectable via CVE-2025-63389.

**Why it matters**

An embedding model indicates an active RAG pipeline, documents loaded into your vector store are reachable via unauthenticated queries.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
