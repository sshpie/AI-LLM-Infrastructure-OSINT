I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (Information Technology Park) has an Ollama instance with an unusually named model `final-exploit-v1:latest` and a `gpt-oss:latest` cloud proxy. The `final-exploit-v1` model is 168 bytes, the size of a cloud proxy artifact, not a local model, suggesting a custom-named cloud redirect.

## Findings

**F1, Unauthenticated Ollama API (HIGH):** All models accessible without credentials.

**F2, `final-exploit-v1` Cloud Proxy Artifact (MEDIUM):** The model is 168 bytes, identical size pattern to standard cloud proxy models (deepseek-v4-pro:cloud = 344 bytes, minimax = 384 bytes). Modified January 2026. No system prompt returned. Inference returns empty response. Likely a student-created cloud proxy with custom naming.

**F3, gpt-oss Cloud Proxy (HIGH):** `gpt-oss:latest` 12GB present. Status (200 OK vs 401) not confirmed on final probe.

**F4, Model Injection (HIGH):** All models injectable via CVE-2025-63389.

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run inference against your cloud API subscription at your expense, this constitutes direct quota/billing theft. The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
