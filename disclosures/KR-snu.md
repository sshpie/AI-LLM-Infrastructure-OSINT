I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Seoul National University (SNU, 서울대학교) has an Ollama instance at 147.47.200.153 with two large cloud proxy models. The 401 response on cloud proxy inference reveals the Ollama Connect service account username and SSH public key.

## Findings

### F1: Credential Leak via 401 Response (CRITICAL)

Cloud proxy inference returns Ollama Connect signin URL containing base64-encoded SSH public key:

```
{"error":"unauthorized","signin_url":"https://ollama.com/connect?name=node1&key=c3NoLWVkMjU1MT..."}
```

Decoded:
- **Username:** `node1`
- **SSH pubkey:** `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIEc/PPDVTM/k5JSpGzWGbwkpMAMWFyOj57QhQAL7hYDC`

The `node1` username pattern indicates a service account or generic node account.

### F2: Cloud Proxy Portfolio (HIGH)

`devstral-2:123b-cloud` and `deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud` are present. No 200 OK confirmed (both return `{"error":"unauthorized"}`).

### F3: CVE-2025-63389 Injectable (HIGH)

All models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`.

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run inference against your cloud API subscription at your expense, this constitutes direct quota/billing theft. The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
