I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

The Computer Science department at the University of Manitoba (`quail.cs.umanitoba.ca`) is running Ollama with five large local models including DeepSeek-R1:70B, Llama 3.3, and Llama 3:70B, a deep research stack totaling ~156GB of local models, all accessible without authentication.

| smollm2:135m | 0 GB |

Total local compute: ~133 GB across 5 models.

## Findings

**F1, Unauthenticated CS Research Server (HIGH):** Named GPU server in CS department. Research models (DeepSeek-R1, large Llama) and code model (Qwen2.5-Coder) exposed to the public internet.

**F2, Model Injection (HIGH):** All 5 models injectable via CVE-2025-63389, attacker can overwrite system prompts, affecting any research workflows using this Ollama instance.

---

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run uncapped inference against your GPU at your compute cost, and inject malicious system prompts into any loaded model via CVE-2025-63389.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
