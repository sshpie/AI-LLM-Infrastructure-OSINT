I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Sri Lanka's academic network (LEARN, Lanka Education and Research Network) has an Ollama instance at 192.248.70.139 with a `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` subscription and `llama3.2-vision`. The cloud proxy 401 response leaks the Ollama Connect account username `modelserver` and corresponding SSH public key.

## Findings

### F1: Credential Leak (user: modelserver) (HIGH)

Querying the `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` model triggers a 401 response containing the Ollama Connect account credentials:

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "signin_url": "https://ollama.com/connect?name=modelserver&key=AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIBefRlkywyAvwYWiTapAKIiPnTAKLic1GNxEZeJfwG6l"
}
```

- **Username:** `modelserver`
- **SSH Public Key:** `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIBefRlkywyAvwYWiTapAKIiPnTAKLic1GNxEZeJfwG6l`

The username `modelserver` is a service account pattern, suggesting institutional deployment rather than a personal workstation.

### F2: Unauthenticated Inference (HIGH)

Both models accessible without authentication. `llama3.2-vision` enables multimodal inference (image + text) at LEARN's expense.

### F3: CVE-2025-63389 Injectable (HIGH)

Both models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`.

**Why it matters**

The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
