I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

A development server at the University of Hertfordshire's RobotHouse facility (`robothouse-dev.herts.ac.uk`) is running Ollama with `gpt-oss:latest` cloud proxy returning **200 OK** without credentials, free-tier cloud quota consumed at operator expense by any internet caller. 103 tokens consumed during research confirmation.

## Findings

### F1: Free-Tier Cloud Proxy 200 OK (CRITICAL)

`gpt-oss:latest` returns full inference without authentication. 103 tokens total consumed (69 prompt + 34 output) during research confirmation:

```bash
curl -X POST http://147.197.191.230:11434/api/chat \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-oss:latest","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"say hi"}],"stream":false}'
# 200 OK - "Hi! 👋" - operator quota consumed
```

### F2: Research Lab Dev Server (HIGH)

The `robothouse-dev.herts.ac.uk` hostname indicates this is a development/staging server in the RobotHouse robotics research facility. LLM API abuse or injection could affect robot-planning pipelines or research workflows connected to this Ollama instance.

### F3: Model Injection (HIGH)

Both models injectable via CVE-2025-63389.

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run inference against your cloud API subscription at your expense, this constitutes direct quota/billing theft. The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
