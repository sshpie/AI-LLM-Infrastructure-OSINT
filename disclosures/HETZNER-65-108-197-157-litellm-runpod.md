I'm an independent security researcher conducting good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella (CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364, ICSA-25-140-11). This is an unsolicited coordinated-disclosure notification.

## Summary

Hetzner customer host `65.108.197.157` is running an unauthenticated **LiteLLM Proxy** on port 4000. The proxy fronts:

- The operator's local Ollama CPU instance (internal hostname `ollama-cpu`) with 4 models loaded
- 4 RunPod GPU pods, each fronting a different premium model (DeepSeek-V4, StepFun step-3.5-flash, Qwen3-VL-72B-AWQ, StepFun step-3-256k)

The proxy's admin endpoints (`/v1/model/info`, `/v1/models`, `/user/info`, `/global/spend`, `/spend/tags`) are reachable without authentication. The proxy's `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint accepts requests without authentication and returns valid completions, i.e., **anyone with the IP can consume the operator's compute (local Ollama CPU + RunPod GPU minutes) for free**.

A LiteLLM virtual key was disclosed via `/user/info`:

```json
{
  "token": "ddaffcaea6b1dde352a4dd09d92a43cde54d8e468532c4cdd34fd51ac23d1836",
  "key_name": "sk-...Rnlw",
  "created_at": "2026-02-23T15:10:31",
  "updated_at": "2026-03-15T03:51:41"
}
```

This key was observed in the public response, not used for authentication. The key should be rotated regardless.

The host has been in 's ledger since the original Ollama Cloud survey (2026-05-02) as a billing-theft target; the LiteLLM proxy was surfaced today via cross-survey-correlation probing of port 4000 across the existing ledger IPs. Full case study at:

"gpu-longctx"
"qwen25-14b"

$ curl -s 'http://65.108.197.157:4000/model/info' | jq '.data[] | {model_name, api_base: .litellm_params.api_base}'
{ "model_name": "local-primary",  "api_base": "http://ollama-cpu:11434" }
{ "model_name": "local-backup",   "api_base": "http://ollama-cpu:11434" }
{ "model_name": "local-vision",   "api_base": "http://ollama-cpu:11434" }
{ "model_name": "gpu-coder",      "api_base": "https://api.runpod.ai/v2/{RUNPOD_DEEPSEEK_V4_ID}/openai/v1" }
{ "model_name": "gpu-math",       "api_base": "https://api.runpod.ai/v2/{RUNPOD_STEP35_FLASH_ID}/openai/v1" }
{ "model_name": "gpu-vision",     "api_base": "https://api.runpod.ai/v2/{RUNPOD_QWEN_VL72_ID}/openai/v1" }
{ "model_name": "gpu-longctx",    "api_base": "https://api.runpod.ai/v2/{RUNPOD_STEP3_256K_ID}/openai/v1" }
{ "model_name": "qwen25-14b",     "api_base": "http://ollama-cpu:11434" }

$ # Functional inference verified once with max_tokens=1 (single-token PoC):
$ curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"model":"qwen25-14b","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"OK"}],"max_tokens":1}' \
    'http://65.108.197.157:4000/v1/chat/completions'
{"id":"chatcmpl-...","object":"chat.completion","model":"qwen25-14b",
 "choices":[{"finish_reason":"stop","index":0,
             "message":{"content":"Hello","role":"assistant"}}]}
```

The single completion above is the only inference call  made. No further requests against the GPU-backed models were issued. The disclosure-PoC consumed the operator's local Ollama CPU for ~35 prompt + 1 completion token.

## Why this matters

For the customer (operator):

- **RunPod billing theft.** Each call to `gpu-coder` / `gpu-math` / `gpu-vision` / `gpu-longctx` invokes RunPod's per-second pod billing. A 72B-class GPU pod runs ~$1–3/hr; sustained external traffic against the gateway directly translates to operator GPU spend.
- **Internal architecture leakage.** The hostname `ollama-cpu` and the RunPod pod-ID env templating (`{RUNPOD_DEEPSEEK_V4_ID}` etc.) reveal the operator's internal Docker / K8s service-discovery layout.
- **Virtual key disclosed.** Even though the proxy is currently auth-off (anyone hits `/v1/chat/completions` directly), the disclosed key indicates the operator has configured key-based auth in LiteLLM. The key should be rotated as part of remediation.
- **Active production traffic.** `/spend/tags` shows real client requests across 6+ distinct user-agents (Edge browser, curl, Python SDK, Go HTTP client, Node undici). The gateway is being used by real consumers.

For Hetzner abuse:

- Customer needs notification. The fixes are operator-side and cheap (LiteLLM has built-in master-key auth via `LITELLM_MASTER_KEY` env var). The customer is reachable through Hetzner's standard customer-channel.

## Remediation (for the customer)

Three fixes (any one closes the exposure; all three is best practice):

```bash
# 1. Enable LiteLLM's master-key auth (one env var):
export LITELLM_MASTER_KEY="sk-<random-32-bytes>"
# Restart the proxy. All requests now require Bearer <key>. The disclosed
# virtual key (ddaffcaea6...23d1836) should be rotated via /key/regenerate
# before re-enabling.

# 2. Restrict the admin endpoints separately:
# Set general_settings.disable_admin_endpoints in litellm config.yaml
# Or: ufw deny 4000/tcp on the host and reverse-proxy through nginx with
# auth at the proxy layer.

# 3. Bind LiteLLM to localhost-only (since `ollama-cpu` is internal anyway):
# In docker-compose or run command:
#   --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4000
# Then reach it via SSH tunnel or VPN, not the public IP.
```

For the disclosed virtual key: rotate via the LiteLLM admin API:
```
POST /key/regenerate -H 'Authorization: Bearer <master-key>'
     -d '{"key": "ddaffcaea6b1dde352a4dd09d92a43cde54d8e468532c4cdd34fd51ac23d1836"}'
```

Happy to coordinate verification or extract additional traffic-pattern detail if Hetzner abuse needs it for the customer notification.
