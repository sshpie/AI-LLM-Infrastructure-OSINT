I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

State University of New York at Buffalo research compute node running 26 Ollama models including `gemma4:31b-cloud`, a cloud proxy model. **Cloud proxy inference confirmed live, 200 OK response at operator expense.** Also includes RAG pipeline components (embedding model + reranker) and a 74GB Mixtral instance. Raw Ollama port publicly accessible, no authentication.

## Findings

### F1: Cloud Proxy Quota Hijack (CRITICAL)

`gemma4:31b-cloud` returned **200 OK** without any authentication:

```bash
curl http://136.183.56.88:11434/api/generate \
  -d '{"model":"gemma4:31b-cloud","prompt":"say: Buffalo","stream":false}'
# → 200 OK, response: "Buffalo", eval_count: 2
```

Two tokens generated at operator's cloud API expense. No authentication, no rate limiting visible from outside.

### F2: Unauthenticated RAG Pipeline Components (HIGH)

The deployment includes BGE-M3 embedding model and BGE-reranker-v2-M3, indicating an active RAG pipeline. If this Ollama instance backs a document retrieval system with university data, model injection via CVE-2025-63389 would affect all RAG-augmented responses, including content derived from indexed university documents.

```bash
# Inject into any model to affect RAG responses
curl -X POST http://136.183.56.88:11434/api/create \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3:14b","from":"qwen3:14b","system":"[attacker instructions]"}'
```

### F3: 26-Model Unauthenticated Surface (HIGH)

26 models accessible including heavy compute (Mixtral 8x22B, Qwen2.5-72B, LLaMA3.1-70B). All injectable via CVE-2025-63389. Total local model storage: ~350+ GB.

---

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run inference against your cloud API subscription at your expense, this constitutes direct quota/billing theft. An embedding model indicates an active RAG pipeline, documents loaded into your vector store are reachable via unauthenticated queries.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
