## Summary

Two OVH-hosted MCP servers identified as `brightwavess-monitor v1.0.0` expose 10 tools each, including **full Cloudflare DNS CRUD** (`cloudflare_list_dns_records`, `cloudflare_create_dns_record`, `cloudflare_update_dns_record`, `cloudflare_delete_dns_record`) plus monitoring (`check_uptime`, `check_db_health`) and Slack alerting. The MCP server has the operator's **Cloudflare API key baked into its configuration**, any unauthenticated caller hitting the JSON-RPC endpoint can:

- List, create, update, or delete DNS records on whatever Cloudflare zone(s) the operator's key authorizes
- **Domain-takeover primitive**: point A records or NS records at attacker-controlled infrastructure to intercept all traffic to the operator's domains (mail, web, API)

Found during 's MCP cross-cloud survey (2026-05-04). Full case study: AI-LLM-Infrastructure-OSINT/blob/main/case-studies/commercial/mcp-cloud-survey-2026-05.md (search for "F12, `brightwavess-monitor`").

## Confirmed exposure

`POST /` (JSON-RPC) returns a successful `initialize` response identifying both hosts as `brightwavess-monitor v1.0.0`. `tools/list` enumerates 10 tools per host:

```
check_uptime, check_db_health,
cloudflare_list_dns_records, cloudflare_create_dns_record,
cloudflare_update_dns_record, cloudflare_delete_dns_record,
slack_send_message, ...
```

Verification was non-destructive, only `initialize` and `tools/list` were called. No DNS records were enumerated, modified, or deleted; no Slack messages were sent.

## Fleet pattern

Two instances with **identical 10-tool surfaces** and identical version strings on OVH ranges (`15.235.x` Beauharnois + `158.69.x` Beauharnois) suggest either:

1. One operator running a 2-node fleet
2. A common open-source `brightwavess-monitor` template adopted by two operators with shared deployment patterns

Either way: the operator's Cloudflare API key has been reachable on the public internet by any unauthenticated caller for the duration these endpoints have been exposed. **The operator should rotate their Cloudflare API key immediately**, regardless of whether they take any further action.

## Remediation

1. **Rotate the Cloudflare API key** referenced by `brightwavess-monitor` at `dash.cloudflare.com → My Profile → API Tokens → Roll`. Assume the previous key has been observed.
2. **Bind the MCP transport to localhost or restrict via firewall**:
   ```
   # If served by FastMCP / uvicorn:
   uvicorn brightwavess_monitor:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3000

   # Or firewall:
   ufw deny 3000/tcp
   ufw allow from 127.0.0.1 to any port 3000
   ```
3. **Audit Cloudflare DNS records** on the affected zone(s) for unauthorized changes during the exposure window.
