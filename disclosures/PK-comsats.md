I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

COMSATS (Commission on Science and Technology for Sustainable Development in the South), an intergovernmental international organization with a university campus network, has an Ollama instance with two MedGemma medical AI models (27B and 4B) alongside a Kimi K2.6 cloud proxy. The presence of medical-domain AI models on a publicly accessible research network endpoint raises data-handling concerns.

## Findings

### F1: Medical AI Models Exposed Without Authentication (HIGH)

`puyangwang/medgemma-27b-it:q8` (29.6GB, 27.4B params, Gemma3 family) is a community quantization of Google's MedGemma, a model specifically designed for medical question answering, clinical note processing, and health professional workflows. Co-located alongside `medgemma-1.5-4b-it`, the deployment suggests active medical AI research or clinical support tooling.

Both models are accessible without authentication, allowing unauthenticated parties to:
- Query the models with arbitrary medical content
- Inject system prompts via CVE-2025-63389 to alter medical AI behavior
- Potentially extract any RAG-loaded clinical documents via embedding queries

### F2: Cloud Proxy Present (Unauthorized) (MEDIUM)

`kimi-k2.6:cloud` is present but returns `{"error": "unauthorized"}` with no credential leak in the 401 response body. No quota drain confirmed.

### F3: CVE-2025-63389 Injectable (HIGH)

All models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`. System prompt injection on medical models is particularly sensitive, an adversary could instruct `medgemma-27b` to provide dangerous medical advice or suppress safety caveats.

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run inference against your cloud API subscription at your expense, this constitutes direct quota/billing theft. The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services. An embedding model indicates an active RAG pipeline, documents loaded into your vector store are reachable via unauthenticated queries. Medical AI models exposed without authentication create compliance risk (potential HIPAA/patient-data adjacent exposure depending on RAG content).

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
