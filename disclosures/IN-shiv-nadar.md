I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence (India, Noida) is running a 5-node shared AI cluster with all nodes exposed on 0.0.0.0:11434, collectively serving 75+ models per node. These include a 376GB local DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B parameters), `qwen3:235b` (132GB), chest X-ray / lung AI research models, and 30+ cloud proxy subscriptions including pre-release `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud`, `devstral-2:123b-cloud`, and `qwen3.5:397b-cloud`. The cluster grew from 3 to 5 nodes between initial discovery (2026-05-01) and this disclosure update (2026-05-03), indicating active infrastructure buildout under continued exposure.

## Infrastructure

| Node | IP | Hostname | Notes |
|------|-----|----------|-------|
| Node 1 | 103.27.166.36 | 36-166-27-103.noida.snu.in | cloud proxy |
| Node 2 | 103.27.166.37 | 37-166-27-103.noida.snu.in | cloud proxy + **medical AI** |
| Node 3 | 103.27.166.38 | 38-166-27-103.noida.snu.in | cloud proxy |
| Node 4 | 103.27.166.39 | 39-166-27-103.noida.snu.in | cloud proxy + image gen |
| Node 5 | 103.27.166.40 | 40-166-27-103.noida.snu.in | cloud proxy |

All nodes in the 103.27.166.0/24 subnet (`noida.snu.in`). All bind Ollama to 0.0.0.0:11434 without authentication. All running v0.15.2. The cluster expanded from 3 to 5 nodes between 2026-05-01 and 2026-05-03.

## Findings

### F1: 5-Node Cluster Fully Exposed and Growing (CRITICAL)

All five nodes on the `noida.snu.in` subnet expose port 11434 without authentication. The cluster grew from 3 to 5 nodes between 2026-05-01 and 2026-05-03 while remaining fully exposed, the infrastructure is actively expanding without security improvements. The shared model set is injectable across all nodes simultaneously.

### F2: 671B Local Model Accessible for Free Inference (HIGH)

`lordoliver/DeepSeek-V3-0324:671b-q4_k_m` (376GB) is accessible without authentication. Any internet actor can run frontier-class inference at the operator's electricity and hardware cost.

### F3: 30+ Cloud Subscriptions Exposed, Including Pre-Release Models (CRITICAL)

30+ cloud proxy models are exposed across all nodes, including `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` and `deepseek-v4-flash:cloud` (pre-release DeepSeek V4 only available via Ollama Connect beta), `devstral-2:123b-cloud` (Mistral's 123B agent model), and `qwen3.5:397b-cloud` (397B MoE). Any actor can consume these premium/beta subscriptions at the operator's cost.

### F4: Model Injection on All ~75 Models per Node (CRITICAL)

CVE-2025-63389 applies to all models across all five nodes. Any researcher using these models, including the lung AI tools and medical LLMs, receives outputs under attacker-controlled instructions after a single unauthenticated `/api/create` POST.

---

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run uncapped inference against your GPU at your compute cost, and inject malicious system prompts into any loaded model via CVE-2025-63389.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
