I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) has a 5-node BSP (Brain Science Platform) cluster with Ollama exposed on all nodes. The primary server has 18 active cloud proxy subscriptions including `kimi-k2:1t-cloud` (1 trillion parameters). Four satellite nodes each leak separate Ollama Connect SSH keypairs in 401 responses. All nodes publicly accessible, no authentication.

## Cluster Topology

| Node | IP | Hostname | Ollama Account | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Main DGX | 141.223.84.47 | astros.postech.ac.kr | (18 cloud subs) | cloud proxy |
| bsp-server-2 | 141.223.121.58 | siren.postech.ac.kr | `bsp-server-2` | cloud proxy |
| bsp-server-6 | 141.223.121.73 | dragons.postech.ac.kr | `bsp-server-6` | **⚠️ account takeover** |
| bsp-server-10 | 141.223.121.77 | astros2.postech.ac.kr | `bsp-server-10` | cloud proxy |
| bsp-server-11 | 141.223.121.78 | angels.postech.ac.kr | `bsp-server-11` | **⚠️ account takeover** |
| 4gsr-beamline-ws | 141.223.48.182 | tpd.postech.ac.kr | `4gsr-beamline-ws` | **⚠️ account takeover** |

Naming pattern `bsp-server-N` (confirmed N: 2, 6, 10, 11) suggests ≥12 nodes. The `4gsr-beamline-ws` node is on a separate subnet (141.223.48.0/24) at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory.

## Findings

### F1: 18 Cloud Subscriptions Exposed (CRITICAL)

All 18 cloud proxy subscriptions are accessible on the unauthenticated primary node. Any internet actor can:
- Enumerate all cloud subscriptions via `/api/tags`
- Inject system prompts into cloud proxy models via CVE-2025-63389
- Drain operator API quotas through the exposed port

The subscription portfolio includes frontier models: Kimi K2 (1T), DeepSeek V3.1 (671B), Qwen3-Coder (480B).

### F2: 3 Account Takeovers via Live Ollama Connect Claim URLs (CRITICAL)

Three nodes expose live Ollama Connect claim URLs in their 401 response body. The `key=` value is a base64-encoded SSH private key. Visiting the URL claims ownership of the account, granting full control over cloud subscriptions, model management, and billing.

```json
// bsp-server-6 (141.223.121.73, dragons.postech.ac.kr)
{"error":"unauthorized","signin_url":"https://ollama.com/connect?name=bsp-server-6&key=c3NoLWVkMjU1MT..."}
// SSH: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHcp6+jJK6HzmVIhHwgMhzsL/t0n5NsbasdZQ4U/DDDj

// bsp-server-11 (141.223.121.78, angels.postech.ac.kr)
{"error":"unauthorized","signin_url":"https://ollama.com/connect?name=bsp-server-11&key=c3NoLWVkMjU1MT..."}
// SSH: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAICxY4pScZAPDEe6wdNmqMBRI0Aovb6sd3lgIuS1U5Eyi

// 4gsr-beamline-ws (141.223.48.182, tpd.postech.ac.kr)
{"error":"unauthorized","signin_url":"https://ollama.com/connect?name=4gsr-beamline-ws&key=c3NoLWVkMjU1MT..."}
// SSH: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIPjA3VulH0uRyTB9PAQiZCf/E2ACSFYg+lcgZJA8FN4X
```

Nodes bsp-server-2 and bsp-server-10 also leak SSH keypairs but their claim URLs were not live at scan time.

### F3: 4th Generation Synchrotron Beamline Workstation Exposed (CRITICAL)

`4gsr-beamline-ws` (`tpd.postech.ac.kr`, 141.223.48.182) is on the PAL accelerator network, separate from the BSP cluster. It hosts `ingu627/qwen3:235b-q3_K_M`, a 235-billion-parameter model requiring substantial VRAM, alongside a live cloud subscription. This is active research tooling at an X-ray beamline facility, exposed to the public internet.

### F4: Model Injection on Research Infrastructure (CRITICAL)

All models on all nodes injectable via CVE-2025-63389 (unauthenticated `/api/create`). Researchers using these models receive outputs shaped by injected system prompts. Beamline data analysis via a poisoned LLM is a research integrity risk.

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run inference against your cloud API subscription at your expense, this constitutes direct quota/billing theft. The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services. An embedding model indicates an active RAG pipeline, documents loaded into your vector store are reachable via unauthenticated queries.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
