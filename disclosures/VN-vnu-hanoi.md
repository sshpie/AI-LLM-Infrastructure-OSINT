I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Vietnam National University Ha Noi has an Ollama instance with domain-specific fine-tuned models for legal (CaseHold), biomedical (PubMedQA), and financial (FinQA) question answering, indicating active NLP research pipelines publicly accessible without authentication.

## Findings

**F1, Unauthenticated Ollama API (HIGH):** All models accessible. Research-grade domain-specific models (legal, medical, financial) exposed.

**F2, Domain-Specific Research Models (MEDIUM):** `distill-CaseHold` (legal reasoning), `pubmedqa-distilled` (biomedical Q&A), `finqa-distilled` (financial analysis), active research pipelines. Injection via CVE-2025-63389 affects domain responses.

**Why it matters**

Medical AI models exposed without authentication create compliance risk (potential HIPAA/patient-data adjacent exposure depending on RAG content).

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
