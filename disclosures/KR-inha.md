I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

INHA University (인하대학교) in Incheon has an Ollama instance with 7 models totalling ~133GB including a local `gpt-oss:20b` (20.9B params) and two NVIDIA Nemotron-Cascade 30B models.

**Total local storage:** ~132GB

## Findings

### F1: Local gpt-oss:20b and Dual Nemotron Stack (HIGH)

`gpt-oss:20b` is running locally (12.1GB, 20.9B params). The model family `gpt-oss` is the OpenAI open-source weights release. Both the standard Ollama-tagged version and the direct HuggingFace GGUF pull are present, suggesting the operator downloaded via `hf.co/unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF:Q8_0` first, then aliased it.

The dual `nemotron-cascade-2:30b` and `nemotron-3-nano:30b` stack (both 24.3GB) suggests NVIDIA model evaluation or research use.

### F2: CVE-2025-63389 Injectable (HIGH)

All models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`. The Nemotron and gpt-oss models have no system prompts, post-injection inference is unobstructed.

---

**Why it matters**

An embedding model indicates an active RAG pipeline, documents loaded into your vector store are reachable via unauthenticated queries.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
