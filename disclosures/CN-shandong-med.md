I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

A Shandong Province medicine video graduate school (China) is running Ollama with the 376GB local DeepSeek V3 model (identical stack to Shiv Nadar University, India), an abliterated DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B reasoning model, and a MiniMax cloud proxy. The cloud proxy leaks credentials for account `bowee`. Unauthenticated, publicly accessible.

## Credential Leak

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "signin_url": "https://ollama.com/connect?name=bowee&key=<base64>"
}
```

- **Username:** `bowee`
- **SSH Public Key:** `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIL1tODW/n9caizUJ42IUq8cTYdYlN4z1eVjhOAWfk1Dz`

## Findings

**F1, 376GB DeepSeek V3 Local Model Exposed (CRITICAL):** `lordoliver/DeepSeek-V3-0324:671b-q4_k_m` is a 376GB q4 quantized local deployment of DeepSeek-V3. Identical model seen at Shiv Nadar University (India). Accessible without authentication.

**F2, Abliterated DeepSeek-R1-Distill (HIGH):** `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B-abliterated` has safety fine-tuning removed. A reasoning model with abliterated safety guardrails on a Chinese medical graduate school server.

**F3, Cloud Proxy Credential Leak (HIGH):** `minimax-m2.7:cloud` leaks Ollama Connect username `bowee` and SSH public key.

**F4, Model Injection (HIGH):** All 4 models injectable via CVE-2025-63389.

---

## Pattern Note

The `lordoliver/DeepSeek-V3-0324:671b-q4_k_m` model at 376GB is an unusual deployment for a graduate school, possibly the same model distribution channel as seen at Shiv Nadar University (India, 103.27.166.x). The username `bowee` is likely a Chinese Pinyin or abbreviated personal name.

**Why it matters**

The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services. Medical AI models exposed without authentication create compliance risk (potential HIPAA/patient-data adjacent exposure depending on RAG content).

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
