I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

NTU's GPU cluster node `g1pc2n108.g1.ntu.edu.tw` (140.112.233.108) has Ollama exposed on port 11434 with 11 models skewed heavily toward vision and multimodal tasks, including GLM-OCR, GLM-4.7-Flash, MiniCPM-V, LLaVA, and llama3.2-vision.

## Findings

### F1: Unauthenticated Inference on University GPU Cluster (HIGH)

All 11 models are publicly accessible without authentication. The heavy multimodal/vision focus, GLM-4.7-Flash, GLM-OCR, LLaVA, MiniCPM-V, moondream, llama3.2-vision, indicates this node serves active vision research or document processing workflows.

**GLM-OCR** (glm-ocr:latest) is a specialized optical character recognition model. Any documents being processed through this pipeline are accessible to unauthenticated callers.

### F2: CVE-2025-63389 Injectable (HIGH)

All 11 models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`.

## NTU Footprint

Multiple NTU nodes have been identified across different departments:

| Node | IP | Hostname | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| EE Dept | 140.112.91.82 |, | Engineering department node |
| PC-214 | 140.112.18.214 |, | Workstation/lab |
| GPU Cluster 1 Node 108 | 140.112.233.108 | g1pc2n108.g1.ntu.edu.tw | Vision stack |

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run uncapped inference against your GPU at your compute cost, and inject malicious system prompts into any loaded model via CVE-2025-63389.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
