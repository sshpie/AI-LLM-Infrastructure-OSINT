I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

SUNY Stony Brook Biology Department server (`040-218.bio.sunysb.edu`) is running Ollama with the full Allen AI OLMo-3 research stack (olmo-3, olmo-3.1-32b-think, olmo-3.1-32b-instruct) alongside `gpt-oss:latest` cloud proxy and several Gemma 4 models. Unauthenticated, publicly accessible.

## Findings

**F1, Biology Research Server (HIGH):** OLMo models (Allen AI's open research language models) suggest active NLP/bioinformatics research. Model injection via CVE-2025-63389 affects research outputs.

**F2, Cloud Proxy Exposure (HIGH):** `gpt-oss:latest` present. Status (200 OK vs 401) not confirmed in final probe.

**F3, Model Injection (HIGH):** All models injectable via CVE-2025-63389.

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run inference against your cloud API subscription at your expense, this constitutes direct quota/billing theft.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
