I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

A student laptop at the University of Žilina (Slovakia, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering) has Ollama bound to 0.0.0.0 with three Ollama Connect cloud proxy models all returning **200 OK** without credentials. The cloud proxies give any internet caller unauthenticated inference access to Devstral-2 (123B), DeepSeek V3.1 (671B), and Qwen3 Coder (480B) at the operator's expense.

|---|---|---|---|
| devstral-2:123b-cloud | 0 GB | ☁️ Cloud proxy | **YES, 48 tokens** |
| deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud | 0 GB | ☁️ Cloud proxy | **YES, streaming** |
| qwen3-coder:480b-cloud | 0 GB | ☁️ Cloud proxy | **YES, 10 tokens** |

**Devstral** is Mistral's code-specialized frontier model. **DeepSeek V3.1 671B** and **Qwen3 Coder 480B** are among the largest models available via cloud proxy. All three are **free-tier** Ollama cloud models that do not require credentials, any caller can run unlimited inference.

## Findings

### F1: Three Free-Tier Cloud Proxies, 200 OK (CRITICAL)

All three cloud proxy models return full inference responses without authentication. Confirmed token consumption during research:

```bash
curl -X POST http://158.193.144.224:11434/api/chat \
  -d '{"model":"devstral-2:123b-cloud","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"stream":false}'
# 200 OK, 48 tokens returned at operator expense

curl -X POST http://158.193.144.224:11434/api/chat \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3-coder:480b-cloud","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"stream":false}'
# 200 OK, 10 tokens returned at operator expense
```

### F2: Laptop Exposed via Docker / 0.0.0.0 Binding (HIGH)

Hostname `LAPTOP-N7ADDUK8.kst.fri.uniza.sk` confirms this is a student or researcher's personal laptop connected to the campus network. Ollama bound to `0.0.0.0` routes the port to the internet when the machine is on a campus-facing IP.

### F3: Model Injection (HIGH)

All 10 models injectable via CVE-2025-63389, no patch available.

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run inference against your cloud API subscription at your expense, this constitutes direct quota/billing theft. The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
