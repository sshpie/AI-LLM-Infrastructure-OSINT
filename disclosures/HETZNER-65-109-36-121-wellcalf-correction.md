**Re:** Correction to prior disclosure on `65.109.36.121` (sent earlier today)
**IP:** 65.109.36.121 (Hetzner Helsinki)
**Severity:** CRITICAL (Metabase setup-token finding), same as prior; data-class framing corrected

---

I sent an unsolicited disclosure earlier today framing this customer as a "pediatric medical ML operator" with HIPAA-relevant data. **That framing was wrong.** Deeper enumeration of the MLflow experiment metadata reveals the operator is **WellCalf ML, a LIVESTOCK / VETERINARY AI startup** (cattle, calf, and goat behavioral health classifiers from sensor data). No human-patient data is involved.

This message corrects the prior disclosure. The technical findings stand; the data-class framing is the only thing that changes.

## What the operator actually does

The MLflow experiment metadata at `http://65.109.36.121:5000/api/2.0/mlflow/experiments/search` shows:

- **Source path:** `/home/avudai/avudai/code/wellcalf_ml/wellcalf_ml/models/machine_learning/model_train.py`
- **Classification targets:** `standing_vs_lying` (cattle posture detection from accelerometer data), `sick_vs_hlt` (sick-vs-healthy), feeding pattern detection, ear monitoring, rectal-temperature classification
- **User-tagged farm IDs:** `Farm_1025`, `Farm_1041`, `Olway_Adult`, `Olway` (these are real farm-customer identifiers in the WellCalf product)
- **Animal categories** in experiment names: `calf`, `cow`, `goat`, `adult`, `behaviour`, `feeding`, `milk`, `lying`, `standing`
- **Decoded prefix `beh_ped`:** behavioral classifier for young calves (pediatric in the veterinary sense, NOT human pediatric medicine)
- **Decoded prefix `sic_tmt`** (72 experiments, the dominant category): sick-treatment / sick-vs-healthy treatment-prediction models

Sample-counts on the most-recent experiment (2026-04-28): 3,114,417 "sick" sensor-readings + 814,072 "healthy", consistent with multi-second sensor data over many cows over many days. Not a per-patient medical-record corpus.

WellCalf ML appears to be a livestock-monitoring IoT product, neck-collar sensors on calves and adult cattle, behavioral patterns ingested for early disease detection. The operator domain `wellcalf.com` is registered (NameCheap) but the public site was not enumerated in this disclosure.

## What the original disclosure got right (still applies: please action)

- **Metabase v0.55.12** at `http://65.109.36.121:3000/api/session/properties` returns `setup-token: "8f504ffb-d62d-4fa3-a03f-053cf7740a32"` UNCLAIMED. Anyone calling `POST /api/setup` with that token claims the Metabase admin slot. **Severity: CRITICAL, pre-auth admin takeover.**
- **MLflow 2.22.1** unauth on port 5000 with 224 experiments visible, confirms full operator-IP exfil at scale (4 years of WellCalf's veterinary-AI development).
- **17 database drivers** configured server-side in Metabase (Databricks, Druid, PostgreSQL, Spark SQL, MongoDB, etc), once admin is claimed, attacker has SQL access to whichever databases the operator has actually wired up.

## What the original disclosure got wrong

- **Data class framing:** "pediatric medical ML" / "HIPAA-relevant" / "patient-identifiable content", none of these apply. The data is veterinary sensor data on cattle / calves / goats. HIPAA scope does not include animal data; FDA / USDA frameworks may apply for veterinary-AI products but BAA / OCR notification is not relevant.
- **Severity escalation rationale:** the upgrade from "HIGH" (existing ledger MLflow finding) to "CRITICAL" was based on the Metabase pre-auth admin takeover path, that escalation rationale stands. The "HIPAA-class" framing was an additional incorrect basis.

## Recommended action (unchanged from prior disclosure)

1. Notify customer to claim the Metabase setup-token immediately (race window remains open).
2. Restrict MLflow + Metabase to admin-only network access.
3. Audit Metabase database connections to ensure read-only scoping.

The technical reproduction commands in the prior disclosure are unchanged; please refer to that message for the curl-based verification steps.

## Methodology note

The misattribution traces back to a token-level keyword match, both 's original 2026-05-04 cloud survey and my disclosure today read `beh_ped` as "behavioral pediatric (human)" when the source path `/home/avudai/avudai/code/wellcalf_ml/` makes the veterinary context unambiguous. The error was caught in deeper enumeration (pulling actual experiment runs with their full param + tag set) which surfaced the `Farm_1025` / `Olway_Adult` / `goat` / `calf` / `cow` taxonomy.

Lesson for future disclosures: always pull at least one full run record (with `mlflow.source.name` + custom user tags) before publishing a data-class framing. Token-pattern matching on experiment names is unreliable.

I apologize for the misframing in the prior message. The Metabase setup-token finding remains CRITICAL and the customer notification path is unchanged.
