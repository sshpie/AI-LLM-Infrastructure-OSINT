I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

A Dell PowerEdge R640 server in Syracuse University's School of Information Studies (`ist-r640-mafudge.syr.edu`) is running Ollama on non-standard port 12345 with `gemma4:31b-cloud` returning **200 OK** without credentials. Five cloud proxy subscriptions total.

## Findings

### F1: Free-Tier Cloud Proxy 200 OK on Non-Standard Port (CRITICAL)

`gemma4:31b-cloud` returns full inference without credentials on port 12345:

```bash
curl -X POST http://128.230.38.78:12345/api/chat \
  -d '{"model":"gemma4:31b-cloud","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"stream":false}'
# 200 OK - "Hello! How can I help you today?"
```

### F2: Non-Standard Port Exposes Intentional or Misconfigured Deployment (HIGH)

Ollama running on port 12345 (not default 11434) may indicate intentional non-standard deployment or a misconfigured service that bypasses default port-filtering rules.

### F3: Model Injection (HIGH)

All models injectable via CVE-2025-63389.

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run inference against your cloud API subscription at your expense, this constitutes direct quota/billing theft. The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
