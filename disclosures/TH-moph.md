I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Thailand's Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) has an Ollama instance at 203.157.41.151 with 5 models publicly accessible, including `granite3.2-vision:2b` (IBM's vision-language model) and `qwen3.6:35b` (22GB). No authentication, no Open WebUI fronting the API.

## Findings

### F1: Government Health Ministry Inference Exposed (HIGH)

All 5 models are accessible without authentication on a Thai government Ministry of Public Health IP. Any internet actor can:
- Run inference against `qwen3.6:35b` (22GB, large model) at MoPH compute cost
- Submit images to `granite3.2-vision:2b` for analysis
- Enumerate all configured models via `/api/tags`

The `granite3.2-vision:2b` model carries IBM's default system prompt (not customized), indicating likely development/testing rather than a custom healthcare application.

No Open WebUI was detected on port 3000. The Ollama API is directly exposed with no frontend authentication layer.

### F2: CVE-2025-63389 Injectable (HIGH)

All 5 models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`. If any of these models are being used for internal MoPH workflows, injected prompts affect those users.

---

**Why it matters**

Medical AI models exposed without authentication create compliance risk (potential HIPAA/patient-data adjacent exposure depending on RAG content).

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
