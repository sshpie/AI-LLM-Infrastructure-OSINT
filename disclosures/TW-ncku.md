I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), one of Taiwan's top engineering universities, has an Ollama instance running on non-standard port 22222. The MiniMax cloud proxy leaks the Ollama Connect account `nckusoc-3090`, indicating NCKU School of Computing (SOC) department server with an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU.

## Credential Leak

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "signin_url": "https://ollama.com/connect?name=nckusoc-3090&key=<base64>"
}
```

- **Username:** `nckusoc-3090`
- **SSH Public Key:** `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMwH+iskAm2POkZim1R1+IHud67QvLGpB7DRs19xh/pb`

`nckusoc` = NCKU School of Computing; `3090` = NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU identifier.

---

## Findings

**F1, Credential Leak via Non-Standard Port (HIGH):** Ollama running on port 22222 instead of default 11434. MiniMax cloud proxy leaks `nckusoc-3090` account credentials.

**F2, Model Injection (HIGH):** All 8 models injectable via CVE-2025-63389.

## Taiwan MOE TANET Context

Multiple Taiwanese universities share the MOE TANET (Taiwan Academic Network) IP space (140.112.x.x - NTU, 140.114.x.x - NTHU, 140.116.x.x - NCKU, 140.136.x.x - FJU). Ollama instances observed across this network on 2026-05-01:

| IP | Institution | Models | Cloud |
|---|---|---|---|
| 140.112.91.82 | NTU (Electrical Engineering) | 4 | minimax-m2.7 |
| 140.112.18.214 | NTU (PC-214) | 5 |, |
| 140.112.233.108 | NTU (GPU cluster g1) | 11 |, |
| 140.116.82.105 | NCKU / TANET | 8 | deepseek-v4-pro |
| 140.116.158.98 | **NCKU (SOC-3090)** | 8 | minimax-m2.7 |
| 140.136.192.220 | FJU (Medical Public Health) | 8 |, |

**Why it matters**

The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services. Medical AI models exposed without authentication create compliance risk (potential HIPAA/patient-data adjacent exposure depending on RAG content).

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
