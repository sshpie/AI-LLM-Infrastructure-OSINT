I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

The Kyrgyz Research and Education Network (KRENA) has an Ollama instance exposed on port 11434 running a 433GB quantized GLM-5.1 model, the largest single local model observed in this research. The instance also carries a `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` proxy.

## Model Inventory

| Model | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `frob/glm-5.1:744b-a40b-ud-q4_K_XL` | **433GB** | GLM-5.1 MoE, **753.9B params** (verified via `/api/show`), 40B-active, family `glm-dsa`, Q4_K_M quant. (Tag reads `744b`; actual count is higher.) |
| `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` | 0 | Cloud proxy |
| `qwen2.5:7b` | 4GB |, |

## Findings

### F1: 433GB Local Model Publicly Accessible (HIGH)

`frob/glm-5.1:744b-a40b-ud-q4_K_XL` is the largest single local model discovered in this research sweep. The model is actively loaded (responds to `/api/show`); 433GB on disk requires substantial GPU infrastructure to serve. Any internet actor can run inference at KRENA's compute cost.

**Parameter count cross-reference:**
- Tag: `744b-a40b`, declares 744B total, 40B active MoE
- Epoch AI database (GLM-5, Z.ai/Zhipu, 2026-02-17): **744B total**
- KRENA `/api/show` reports `parameter_size: 753.9B` (likely Q4 quant overhead from tokenizer/embedding tensors)

The `frob/` prefix is a Hugging Face community namespace, community quantization of ZhipuAI's GLM-5.1.

### F2: DeepSeek Cloud Proxy (HIGH)

`deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` is present. The 401 response does not include a `signin_url` with credentials (returns plain `{"error": "unauthorized"}`), suggesting either Ollama Connect credential storage differs on this instance or the account uses a non-standard auth path.

### F3: CVE-2025-63389 Injectable (HIGH)

All 5 models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`.

**Why it matters**

The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services. An embedding model indicates an active RAG pipeline, documents loaded into your vector store are reachable via unauthenticated queries.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
