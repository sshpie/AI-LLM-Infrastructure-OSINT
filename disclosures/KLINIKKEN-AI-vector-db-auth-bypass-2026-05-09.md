# Klinikken.ai: Unauthenticated Vector Database API (Auth Bypass via Embedding Proxy)

**Discovered:** 2026-05-09  
**Host:** `37.27.185.38:8001` (Hetzner Online, `static.38.185.27.37.clients.your-server.de`)  
**Severity:** **CRITICAL**, confirmed populated psychotherapy session-notes corpus; GDPR Article 9 special-category mental-health data; user_id partition broken (corpus reachable by guessing `user_id=1`); IDOR-class broken access control; operator's own OpenAPI schema documents `user_id` as *"Bruger ID for isolation"* yet does not authenticate the field; `/search` returns original document text in `SearchResult.text`, making the endpoint a direct corpus-extraction primitive. Severity escalated from HIGH to CRITICAL on 2026-05-09 14:11 UTC after Test A (collection-name enumeration only, no content read) confirmed corpus is populated with clinical session content.  
**Status:** Not yet disclosed

## Summary

Klinikken.ai's self-hosted vector database API is publicly accessible without authentication. The service is the retrieval-augmented memory layer of a Danish clinical AI platform that records and indexes **psychotherapy session notes**. Each therapy session generates one Qdrant collection of chunked text, named `notes_therapist_<therapist_id>_session_<session_uuid>`. The FastAPI embedding proxy (port 8001) wraps a Qdrant backend (port 6333), and the proxy strips Qdrant's API-key authentication, exposing the full corpus via its own endpoints to anyone with curl.

The exposed corpus is GDPR Article 9 special-category health data. Mental-health session content is the most sensitive sub-class of health data, and Danish Sundhedsloven §40 confidentiality applies absolutely. Verification (Test A, 2026-05-09 14:11 UTC), collection-name enumeration only, no document content read, confirmed 28 populated session-notes collections under `user_id=1` (the system's main tenant) with at least 11 distinct therapist IDs visible in the collection-name metadata, and at least ~78 vector points (= ~78 stored text chunks of session content) in that one user_id alone.

This is a two-layer failure:

1. **Auth bypass**, callers route through the unauthenticated FastAPI proxy on port 8001 to reach data that Qdrant's own API key on port 6333 would otherwise protect.
2. **Broken access control / IDOR**, the proxy's `user_id` parameter is documented as `"Bruger ID for isolation"` in the operator's own OpenAPI spec, but is treated as a caller-supplied path parameter rather than an authenticated session principal. Any caller can iterate user_id values; we found the populated tenant on the first guess (`user_id=1`).

## Technical Detail

**Exposed API:** `http://37.27.185.38:8001`  
**Service title:** Klinikken.ai Vector Database API v1.0.0 (OpenAPI 3.1)
**Service description (Danish, from `/openapi.json`):** *"Embeddings og semantic search service med bruger-isolation"*. "Embeddings and semantic search service with user-isolation"
**Swagger UI:** `http://37.27.185.38:8001/docs`
**Server:** uvicorn (FastAPI)

The service's own description states user-isolation as a design property, and every collection-scoped endpoint takes `user_id` as a path parameter (`/collections/{user_id}`, `DELETE /collections/{user_id}/{collection_name}`). However, **`user_id` is supplied by the caller**: there is no authentication and no session binding the caller to a specific user_id, so the user-isolation primitive is unenforced. This is the IDOR class. The system models users, but anyone can substitute any user_id and access that user's collections. The operator built the structure for per-user data partitioning (consistent with the medical-AI use case requiring per-patient or per-clinician scoping) but did not implement the access control layer that prevents user impersonation.

### Verification: corpus is populated and unauthenticated (Test A, 2026-05-09)

Reproducible by the operator with a single curl. We deliberately listed collection NAMES only and never issued a `/search` to read document content:

```bash
$ curl http://37.27.185.38:8001/collections/1
{"user_id":"1","total":28,"collections":[
   {"name":"notes_therapist_<id>_session_<uuid>","points_count":N,...},
   ... 28 entries ...
]}
```

Findings (full unredacted output supplied to operator separately; redacted here to protect therapist + session identifiers ahead of operator notification):

- 28 collections returned under `user_id=1` (no auth header sent)
- All 28 match the pattern `notes_therapist_<numeric_therapist_id>_session_<32_hex_session_uuid>`
- 11 distinct therapist IDs visible in the metadata, mostly clustered in a 7-figure auto-incremented range plus one anomalously low ID
- `points_count` per collection: 1–6 (= chunked vector points of stored session text)
- `/health` reports 32 total Qdrant collections; 28 are under `user_id=1`, 4 under user_id values we did not attempt to enumerate
- All other guessed user_ids (`default`, `test`, `demo`, `admin`, `klinikken`, `anders`, `user`, `0`, `root`, `global`, `public`, `main`, `shared`) returned `{"collections":[],"total":0}`. System accepted any user_id, returning empty for unknown values, populated for `1`

This is sufficient evidence to confirm: (a) the corpus is populated with clinical session content, (b) the user_id partition is not a security boundary, (c) `user_id=1` is the system's main tenant. We did not call `/search`, `/upload`, or `/delete`.

### Health response (no auth required):
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "qdrant": {
    "connected": true,
    "host": "qdrant",
    "port": 6333,
    "collections": 32
  },
  "embedding_model": {
    "name": "paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2",
    "dimension": 384
  }
}
```

### Exposed endpoints (all unauthenticated):
```
GET  /              Status (service, model, embedding dimension)
GET  /health        Backend health including Qdrant state and collection count
POST /upload        Upload document → embed → store in Qdrant
POST /search        Semantic search across all stored documents
POST /delete        Delete document from vector store
GET  /collections/{user_id}           List collections for any user ID
DELETE /collections/{user_id}/{name}  Delete collections for any user ID
```

### OpenAPI schemas (publicly available at `/openapi.json`):

The schemas confirm the user-isolation design intent and reveal that the `/search` endpoint returns original document text, not just scores. Quoted directly from the spec:

`DocumentUpload`:
```
user_id          → "Bruger ID for isolation"   ← caller-controlled, no auth
collection_name  → example: 'chatbot_knowledge'
text             → "Tekst der skal chunkes og embeddes"
metadata         → free-form object
```

`SearchQuery`:
```
user_id          → "Bruger ID for isolation"   ← caller-controlled, no auth
collection_name  → required
query            → "Søgeforespørgsel"
limit            → up to 100 per request
score_threshold  → 0–1 (set to 0 to dump regardless of similarity)
```

`SearchResult`:
```
document_id, text, score, metadata          ← text is the raw chunk, not an embedding
```

The `text` field in `SearchResult` is the original document chunk in plain text, returned directly to any unauthenticated caller. `/search` is therefore a literal corpus-extraction primitive: an attacker can iterate user_id values, enumerate `collection_name`s via `GET /collections/{user_id}`, then issue broad queries with `score_threshold=0` and `limit=100` to dump arbitrary user_id collection content.

### Qdrant backend (port 6333):
```
GET /healthz → "healthz check passed"      (no auth)
GET /collections → 401 Requires API key   (auth present)
```

The proxy strips Qdrant's auth. An attacker with access to port 8001 bypasses the Qdrant API key entirely.

## Impact

| Impact | Description |
|---|---|
| **IDOR / broken access control** | `GET /collections/{user_id}` and `DELETE /collections/{user_id}/{name}` accept any user_id without authentication. The operator's own description claims user-isolation; the implementation does not enforce it. Cross-user data access is achievable by simply changing the user_id path parameter. |
| **Data exposure** | `POST /search` returns semantic search results over 32 collections of medical AI content |
| **Data injection** | `POST /upload` allows unauthenticated content injection into clinical AI responses (DocumentUpload schema is publicly documented) |
| **Data destruction** | `POST /delete` and `DELETE /collections/{user_id}/{name}` allow unauthenticated deletion at document and collection scope |
| **User enumeration** | `GET /collections/{user_id}` allows iteration of user_id space to enumerate every user's collection names |
| **Schema disclosure** | `DocumentUpload`, `SearchQuery`, `SearchResult`, `DeleteDocument` schemas published at `/openapi.json` — full API contract without authentication |

With 32 Qdrant collections, this is a substantial medical knowledge base. Content likely includes clinic documentation, patient FAQs, clinical protocols, or patient-interaction records used to power Klinikken.ai's responses.

**Jurisdiction:** Danish GDPR (GDPR as implemented via Databeskyttelsesloven). Operator is Klinikken.ai ApS (CVR 45899071), registered in Faxe, Denmark. Danish Datatilsynet (`dt@datatilsynet.dk`) is the supervisory authority.

**GDPR Article 9 applies**, the corpus contains clinical psychotherapy session notes per Test A's collection-name evidence. Mental-health data is special-category. Article 32 (security of processing) requires "appropriate technical measures"; an unauthenticated, internet-exposed retrieval API does not satisfy this. Article 33 requires breach notification to the supervisory authority within 72 hours of the controller becoming aware. **The 72-hour clock starts on Klinikken.ai ApS at the moment this disclosure is delivered to them.**

**Sundhedsloven §40** (patient confidentiality) and the Danish **bekendtgørelse om informationssikkerhed for behandling af personoplysninger på sundhedsområdet** (executive order on information security in the health sector) impose additional duties beyond GDPR for clinical data. Therapist-patient confidentiality under Danish law is among the strongest legal-professional confidentiality privileges and is not waivable by the controller.

## Remediation

1. **Immediate:** Add authentication to the FastAPI proxy (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header check, or API key query parameter)
2. **Preferred:** Put the embedding proxy behind a reverse proxy that enforces auth at the network boundary
3. **Verify:** Audit Qdrant collections for PII or patient data; assess GDPR notification obligation
4. **Long-term:** Ensure internal services (Qdrant, embedding proxy) are not exposed on public interfaces; bind to localhost or internal VPC only
