I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Monash University (Melbourne, Australia) has an Ollama instance at `vm-118-138-233-225.erc.monash.edu.au` with 8 models totalling over 510GB of local inference including a full **DeepSeek V3.1 671B** (404.5GB), tied with KRENA for largest local deployment in this sweep. Two cloud proxies are present.

## Infrastructure

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| IP | 118.138.233.225 |
| Hostname | vm-118-138-233-225.erc.monash.edu.au |
| Organization | Monash University |
| Network | Monash ERC (Education and Research Cluster, 118.138.0.0/16) |
| Country | Australia |
| Open ports | 11434 (Ollama, public) |

Two additional Monash nodes on the same subnet (118.138.243.239, 118.138.243.34) host smaller stacks (deepseek-r1:latest, qwen2.5, llama3, 3 models each).

## Model Inventory (Primary Node)

| Model | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `deepseek-v3.1:latest` | **404.5GB** | **671.0B params**, DeepSeek2 family, largest model in sweep |
| `qwen3-coder-next:latest` | 51.7GB |, |
| `nemotron-cascade-2:latest` | 24.3GB | NVIDIA Nemotron Cascade 2 |
| `gpt-oss-safeguard:latest` | 13.8GB | gpt-oss 20.9B, `safeguard` variant, no system prompt set |
| `kimi-k2.5:cloud` | 0GB | Cloud proxy |
| `minimax-m2.7:cloud` | 0GB | Cloud proxy |
| `gemma4:latest` | 9.6GB |, |
| `qwen3.5:latest` | 6.6GB |, |

**Total primary node:** ~510GB local + 2 cloud proxies

## Findings

### F1: 404.5GB DeepSeek V3.1 671B Publicly Accessible (HIGH)

`deepseek-v3.1:latest` is verified as 671.0B params (DeepSeek2 family, family confirmed via `/api/show`). At 404.5GB, this requires multi-GPU infrastructure to serve (typically 8×A100/H100 or equivalent). Any internet actor can run uncapped inference against this model at Monash's compute cost.

This is co-ranked with KRENA's GLM-5.1 as the largest local model accessible in the sweep.

### F2: Cloud Proxy Portfolio (HIGH)

`kimi-k2.5:cloud` and `minimax-m2.7:cloud` are present. Both return `{"error":"unauthorized"}` with no credential leak in response body. No quota drain confirmed.

### F3: gpt-oss-safeguard Variant (MEDIUM)

`gpt-oss-safeguard:latest` (13.8GB, 20.9B params) is a named variant of the gpt-oss model with no system prompt set. The `safeguard` tag suggests it was intended to include content filtering, but the system prompt slot is empty, the safeguard was not configured.

### F4: CVE-2025-63389 Injectable (HIGH)

All models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`.

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run inference against your cloud API subscription at your expense, this constitutes direct quota/billing theft. The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
