I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Technical University of Łódź (Politechnika Łódzka) has an Ollama instance on `xray02.p.lodz.pl` with 3 models including a 20GB DeepSeek-R1 and `lukashabtoch/plutotext-r3-emotional:latest`, the same custom emotional-roleplay model observed independently at CEFET/RJ in Brazil and other nodes, indicating cross-institutional propagation of an obscure community fine-tune.

## Findings

### F1: Cross-Network Model Propagation (MEDIUM)

`lukashabtoch/plutotext-r3-emotional:latest` is a low-citation community fine-tune for emotional roleplay. This exact model appears on at least two geographically unrelated institutions (Łódź, Poland and CEFET/RJ, Brazil) suggesting it propagates through shared Hugging Face download patterns or operator-to-operator social sharing. Uncommon model identifiers like this can serve as Shodan/HTTP banner search correlators for cross-network attribution.

### F2: Unauthenticated Inference on Research Server (HIGH)

`deepseek-r1:32b` (19.9GB, 32.8B params) is accessible without authentication. The hostname `xray02` suggests an X-ray / radiological research compute node, making the exposure pattern consistent with a research GPU being repurposed for LLM workloads without access controls.

### F3: CVE-2025-63389 Injectable (HIGH)

All models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`.

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run uncapped inference against your GPU at your compute cost, and inject malicious system prompts into any loaded model via CVE-2025-63389.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
