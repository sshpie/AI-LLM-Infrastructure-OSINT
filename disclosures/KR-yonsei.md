I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Yonsei University (Seoul, South Korea) is running Ollama on non-standard port 5004 with 17 cloud proxy subscriptions matching the pattern seen at POSTECH, Shiv Nadar, Hanoi University, and RIT. `minimax-m2.1:cloud` returns **200 OK** without credentials, confirming free-tier cloud quota drain. Local models include 75GB `qwen3.5:122b` and 65GB `gpt-oss:120b` (MXFP4), indicating a high-VRAM GPU server.

## Findings

### F1: Free-Tier Cloud Proxy 200 OK (CRITICAL)

`minimax-m2.1:cloud` returns full inference without credentials. 40 tokens consumed at operator expense:

```bash
curl -X POST http://1.233.220.117:5004/api/chat \
  -d '{"model":"minimax-m2.1:cloud","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"stream":false}'
# 200 OK - "Hi there! How can I help you today?"
```

### F2: 17 Cloud Subscriptions on Non-Standard Port (CRITICAL)

Running Ollama on port 5004 instead of 11434. All 17 cloud subscriptions accessible.

### F3: Same Cloud Bundle as POSTECH/Shiv Nadar/Hanoi/RIT (HIGH)

The 17-subscription cloud portfolio overlaps with the 18-bundle pattern seen at POSTECH (KR), Shiv Nadar (IN), Hanoi University (VN), and RIT (US). This is a distinct subset, shared Ollama Connect demonstration account or institutional bundle.

### F4: Large Local Models (HIGH)

75GB and 65GB models accessible. Significant compute resources exposed to unauthenticated callers.

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run inference against your cloud API subscription at your expense, this constitutes direct quota/billing theft. The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.
