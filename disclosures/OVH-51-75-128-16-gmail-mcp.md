I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

A customer of OVH at `51.75.128.16:3000` is running an unauthenticated **Gmail Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that exposes the operator's own Gmail mailbox as a 19-tool API readable + writable + destructive by any unauthenticated internet caller.

This finding was surfaced as part of 's cross-cloud Model Context Protocol survey (2026-05-04). Full case study: AI-LLM-Infrastructure-OSINT/blob/main/case-studies/commercial/mcp-cloud-survey-2026-05.md

## Confirmed exposure

`POST /` (JSON-RPC 2.0) returns a successful `initialize` response identifying the server as `gmail v1.0.0`. A subsequent `tools/list` enumerates 19 callable tools, all of which mutate or read mailbox state:

```
send_email, draft_email, read_email, search_emails, modify_email, delete_email,
list_email_labels, batch_modify_emails, batch_delete_emails,
create_label, update_label, delete_label, get_or_create_label,
create_filter, list_filters, get_filter, delete_filter, create_filter_from_template,
download_attachment
```

The server requires no authentication on the JSON-RPC handshake. Verification was non-destructive: only the `initialize` and `tools/list` JSON-RPC methods were called, no mailbox content was read, no messages were sent, no filters were created.

---

## Why it matters

The exposed MCP server represents **complete remote control** of the operator's Gmail account by any unauthenticated caller. Specifically:

- **Read:** `read_email`, `search_emails`, `download_attachment`, full mailbox read access
- **Write:** `send_email`, `draft_email`, ability to send outbound mail as the operator (impersonation, phishing-source vector)
- **Destructive:** `delete_email`, `batch_delete_emails`, `delete_label`, `delete_filter`, irreversible mailbox modification
- **Lateral:** `create_filter`, attacker can configure forwarding/redirection of incoming mail to attacker-controlled addresses

The operator likely intends this MCP server for their own private use (Claude Desktop, Cursor, or similar AI client integration) but has bound it to `0.0.0.0` instead of localhost.

---

## Remediation (operator)

Bind the MCP server to loopback only:

```
# Whatever process serves the MCP HTTP+SSE endpoint, restrict to 127.0.0.1
# Example (if Node/Python server):
HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=3000 node mcp-gmail-server.js
```

Alternatively, restrict access via firewall:

```
ufw deny 3000/tcp
ufw allow from 127.0.0.1 to any port 3000
```

---

## OVH AUP applicability

OVH's AUP and TOS prohibit operating servers that expose unauthenticated administrative interfaces, regardless of operator intent. This MCP server, while presumably configured for the operator's own AI-tooling use, exposes Gmail mailbox CRUD without authentication on a public OVH IP, meeting the standard "exposed administrative service" criterion.

I leave the AUP determination to OVH; reporting the exposure for awareness and customer-notification.
