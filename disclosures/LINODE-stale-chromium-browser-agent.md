**Re:** Unauthenticated Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) on 2 Linode customer hosts running pre-2023 Chromium = chained-CVE browser-RCE primitive

I'm an independent security researcher conducting good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella (CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364, ICSA-25-140-11). This is an unsolicited coordinated-disclosure notification covering two Linode customer hosts that share the same exposure class.

A parallel notification covering 3 hosts on OVH is being sent separately to `abuse@ovh.net`.

## Summary

Two Linode customer VPSes are running raw Chromium with the Chrome DevTools Protocol (port 9222) exposed unauthenticated AND on pre-2023 Chromium versions. The combination produces a **chained-CVE browser-RCE primitive** beyond the auth-off issue alone.

| Linode host | Port | Platform | Chromium version | Vintage | rDNS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `139.162.36.70` | 9222 | raw Chromium CDP | **HeadlessChrome 100.0.4896.60** | **April 2022** (~4 years stale) | `139-162-36-70.ip.linodeusercontent.com` |
| `172.104.24.241` | 9222 | raw Chromium CDP | **HeadlessChrome 89.0.4389.72** | **March 2021** (~5 years stale) | `172-104-24-241.ip.linodeusercontent.com` |

Found during 's cross-cloud browser-agent survey (2026-05-04). Full case study:

## Confirmed exposure (verification was non-destructive)

For each host, a single `GET /json/version` request returned a valid CDP `Browser` / `User-Agent` / `webSocketDebuggerUrl` JSON response without authentication. The `webSocketDebuggerUrl` is the entrypoint for full CDP control of the headless browser instance.

No CDP `Page.navigate`, `Runtime.evaluate`, `Page.captureScreenshot`, or any other state-changing CDP method was invoked on either host. The exposure was confirmed solely by the `/json/version` discovery endpoint.

---

## Why it matters

The Chrome DevTools Protocol on an unauthenticated WebSocket endpoint gives any caller full programmatic control of the browser, navigate to arbitrary URLs, execute JavaScript in the browser context, read cookies/localStorage/IndexedDB, intercept network traffic, capture screenshots and screencasts.

This is the **framework default behavior**, raw Chromium with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` ships with no authentication on the CDP transport; auth must be bolted on via reverse-proxy or token-gating, which the operators in this population have not done.

The **stale-Chromium dimension** elevates this from "operational exposure" to "RCE-equivalent":

- **Chromium 89 (March 2021)** and **Chromium 100 (April 2022)** carry hundreds of public V8 type-confusion + Blink memory-corruption + sandbox-escape CVEs with **working public exploits** (e.g. CVE-2021-21148 V8 heap buffer overflow ITW, CVE-2021-30551 V8 type confusion, CVE-2022-1232 V8 OOB write, CVE-2022-1853 IndexedDB UAF). An attacker who controls the CDP can simply `Page.navigate` the browser to an attacker-hosted exploit page and chain the stale-Chromium RCE, no separate CDP-bug required.

The combination, unauth CDP + stale Chromium with public exploits, gives an attacker code execution **on the operator's host**, not just within the headless browser.

For Akamai/Linode:

- Two customers, identical exposure class. The `linodeusercontent.com` rDNS prefix is Linode's default (no operator branding visible). A short note from Linode abuse to each customer is the cleanest remediation.

## Remediation (for each customer)

```bash
# 1) Update Chromium to current stable
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y chromium-browser
# Or rebuild the container with a current Chromium base

# 2) Bind to localhost or restrict at the firewall
# If launching Chromium directly:
chromium --remote-debugging-address=127.0.0.1 --remote-debugging-port=9222 ...
# Or firewall:
ufw deny 9222/tcp
ufw allow from <admin-IP> to any port 9222

# 3) If external CDP access is required, front it with an auth-token-validating
# reverse proxy - the CDP protocol itself has no native auth.
```
