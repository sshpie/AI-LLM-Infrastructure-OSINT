**Re:** Unauthenticated Elasticsearch with AI/RAG workload, isideweb (rex3.isideweb.com). DeskPro-integrated CRM / iside2 platform
**IP / Host:** `94.177.165.24` (cluster `elasticsearch (node 'deskpro')`)
**Severity:** HIGH

I'm an independent security researcher conducting good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella (CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364, ICSA-25-140-11). This is an unsolicited coordinated disclosure. No engagement exists with your organization. I have not read, modified, or exfiltrated documents. Only index metadata (schema, counts, sizes) needed to identify the exposure.

## Summary

The Elasticsearch endpoint at `http://94.177.165.24:9200` is reachable from the public internet with no authentication. The cluster carries one or more AI / RAG workloads (dense_vector or knn_vector fields). TLS SAN includes rex3.isideweb.com; ES node name 'deskpro' indicates DeskPro CRM integration.

**State (verified 2026-05-17):** FULLY WIPED. Extortion marker present, iside2 index empty

## Infrastructure

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| IP | `94.177.165.24` |
| ES version | Elasticsearch 7.17.8 |
| Cluster name | `elasticsearch (node 'deskpro')` |
| Country | Italy |
| Hosting | Aruba S.p.A. Dedicated Servers |


### Already wiped (per attacker, between morning probe and second probe today)

| Index | Docs / prior state | Size | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `iside2 (emptied)` | 0 (was 1536d OpenAI embeddings) | — | iside2 platform content destroyed |


## Extortion marker

An index named `read_me` is present on the cluster. This is the calling card of the **Meow / Indexrm extortion campaign**, an automated wipe-and-ransom operation. The marker indicates the attacker has already enumerated your cluster and either has wiped the data or is about to.

Sample marker content typically contains a ransom note pointing to a Bitcoin wallet and an email channel (`wendy.etabw@gmx.com` or one of two clone actor channels, `scandal@onionmail.org`, `db-recovery@sharebot.net`). We have separately reported all three channels to abuse contacts.

**Do not pay.** Our wallet-blockchain analysis (mempool.space) shows only ~5 victims across thousands of marked hosts have paid; the wallet has received roughly 0.018 BTC against a population of 4,400+ marked instances. Paying does not get your data back. The campaign is wipe-first, ransom-as-afterthought.


## Why it matters

The 'iside2' index that was previously serving your isideweb / DeskPro CRM AI knowledge base is now empty. Only the Meow 'read_me' extortion marker remains. The node name 'deskpro' suggests DeskPro CRM integration. Any CRM-side index referencing this ES cluster will be returning empty results for affected operations. Restore from backup and bind the cluster to the loopback interface before re-indexing.

## One-line fix

Bind the Elasticsearch HTTP listener to the loopback interface and require authentication for any non-local client. For a Docker deployment:

```
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:9200:9200 -e xpack.security.enabled=true elasticsearch:7.17.8
```

If the cluster is on a host network: set `network.host: 127.0.0.1` in `elasticsearch.yml`, restart, then put it behind a reverse proxy or VPN with authentication.

For OpenSearch clusters: enable the security plugin with `plugins.security.disabled: false`.

Happy to provide additional forensic detail if useful. No response is required.
