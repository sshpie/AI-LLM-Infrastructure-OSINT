I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

ITMO University (Saint Petersburg, Russia) has an Ollama instance with 24 models including frontier models (Llama 4, Qwen 2.5 VL 72B, Kimi-Dev-72B) and `gpt-oss:20b` / `gpt-oss:120b` cloud proxies. No credential leak detected on active probe, likely paid-tier. Unauthenticated inference against all 24 models.

## Findings

**F1, Unauthenticated Ollama API (CRITICAL):** 24 models including 71GB Kimi-Dev, 65GB VL, and multiple 60GB+ frontier models accessible without credentials.

**F2, Cloud Proxy Presence (HIGH):** `gpt-oss:20b` and `gpt-oss:120b` present. Probe timed out, status (free-tier 200 OK vs paid 401) unconfirmed.

**F3, Model Injection (HIGH):** All 24 models injectable via CVE-2025-63389.

**Why it matters**

Any internet actor can run inference against your cloud API subscription at your expense, this constitutes direct quota/billing theft. The credential leak (username + SSH public key) exposes your service account to enumeration and credential-stuffing against other services.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
