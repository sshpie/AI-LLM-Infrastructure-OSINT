I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

**Note on prior misroute:** I sent the same finding earlier today routed to University at Buffalo (`buffalo.edu`), that was a bug in my disclosure pipeline's domain-resolution heuristic. ARIN WHOIS for `136.183.0.0/16` correctly identifies your institution (`NetName SUCBUFFALO`, `OrgName SUNY Buffalo State University`, `OrgAbuseEmail killiatd@buffalostate.edu`). Catherine Ullman at UB IT Security flagged the misroute. Corrected and resent here. Apologies for the noise.

## Summary

State University of New York at Buffalo State research compute node running 26 Ollama models including `gemma4:31b-cloud`, a cloud proxy model. **Cloud proxy inference confirmed live, 200 OK response at operator expense.** Also includes RAG pipeline components (embedding model + reranker) and a 74GB Mixtral instance. Raw Ollama port publicly accessible, no authentication.

## Findings

### F1: Unauthenticated Ollama (CRITICAL)

Port 11434 is publicly accessible without any auth. All 26 models enumerable via `/api/tags`; all injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint (CVE-2025-63389).

### F2: Cloud Proxy Quota Theft (HIGH: confirmed live)

`gemma4:31b-cloud` is a cloud-proxy model that routes inference through Ollama's commercial cloud at the operator's billing expense. Confirmed live by a non-destructive `/api/generate` call returning HTTP 200 + 2 tokens of completion.

### F3: RAG Pipeline Components (HIGH)

The deployment includes a BGE-M3 embedding model and a BGE-reranker-v2-M3, indicating an active RAG pipeline. If this Ollama instance backs a document retrieval system with university data, model injection via CVE-2025-63389 would affect all RAG-augmented responses.

---

**Why it matters**

The cloud-proxy model is direct billing-impact on the operator's Ollama Cloud subscription. Attacker scripted abuse can drain quota at scale. The RAG pipeline indicates indexed documents, possibly research data, internal documentation, or course materials, accessible via unauth queries. Model injection (CVE-2025-63389) compromises any downstream use of Aiden Assistant-equivalent services on this instance.

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
