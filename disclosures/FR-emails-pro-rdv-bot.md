I'm an independent security researcher. I hold CISA disclosures CVE-2025-4364 and ICSA-25-140-11 and conduct good-faith AI infrastructure research under the  umbrella. This is an unsolicited disclosure, no engagement exists with your organization, and I have not accessed, modified, or exfiltrated any data beyond what was necessary to confirm the exposure.

## Summary

A production French commercial appointment-booking AI assistant, `rdv-bot:latest`, is hosted on an IP attributed to the Romanian National Institute for R&D in Informatics (ICI Bucharest). The PTR record points to `mail.emails-pro.fr`, indicating the IP is operated as a commercial SaaS rather than academic infrastructure. The Ollama API is unauthenticated; the full 5,422-character system prompt is extractable, exposing the SaaS's complete business logic, PII collection pattern, function-call schema, and anti-prompt-injection rules.

|---|---|
| IP | 85.122.129.248 |
| Hostname (PTR) | `mail.emails-pro.fr` |
| Shodan Org Tag | Institutul National de Cercetare-Dezvoltare in informatica - ICI Bucuresti |
| Likely Operator | emails-pro.fr (French SaaS, hosted on Romanian IP space) |
| Country | Romania (host) / France (operator/customers) |
| Open ports | 11434 (Ollama, public) |

## Model Inventory

11 models. Most are stock open models. The custom artifact is:

| Model | Size | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `rdv-bot:latest` | 4GB | **Production French appointment-booking SaaS** |
| `qwen3.6:35b` | 22GB | Likely the larger backing model |
| `gemma2:9b-instruct-q4_K_M` | 5GB |, |
| `qwen2.5:7b-instruct-q4_K_M` | 4GB |, |
| `llama3.1:8b` | 4GB |, |

Plus 6 other stock open models.

## Findings

### F1: Production Commercial SaaS System Prompt Fully Exposed (CRITICAL)

The `/api/show` endpoint returns the complete `rdv-bot:latest` system prompt without authentication. It contains:

**Business identity & target market:**
- Target customers: hairdressers (coiffeur), osteopaths (ostéopathe), beauticians (esthéticienne), and similar appointment-driven small businesses
- Customer-facing language: French only (with explicit instruction to ignore other languages)
- 10 worked few-shot examples covering ambiguous services, English-language clients, medical/product redirects, cancellations, prompt-injection attempts, past dates, off-hours requests

**PII collection schema (function call):**
```
[CREATE_APPOINTMENT]{
  "service_name": "...",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "time": "HH:MM",
  "client_name": "...",
  "client_phone": "...",
  "client_email": "..."
}
```

The bot collects French customer first/last names, phone numbers (e.g., format `0612345678`), and emails for every appointment. The runtime context provided per-request adds: services list, business hours, available slots, current date, business phone number, business name.

**Service catalog (from few-shot examples):**
- Coupe femme (35€), Coupe homme (25€), Coupe enfant (18€), Couleur

**Competitive intelligence exposed:**
- Complete business logic, pricing pattern, anti-prompt-injection ruleset
- The phrase `[CREATE_APPOINTMENT]{...}` is the SaaS's internal tool-call format, competitor or attacker can replicate the exact integration
- Anti-injection rule #7 explicitly named in the prompt, this rule itself is now defeated since attackers know it exists

### F2: CVE-2025-63389 Injection on Live PII-Collecting AI (CRITICAL)

The unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint allows overwriting `rdv-bot:latest`'s system prompt. After such a write, the production SaaS would:
- Continue collecting French customer PII (names, phones, emails)
- But process those collections under attacker-controlled instructions
- Could be redirected to exfiltrate the `[CREATE_APPOINTMENT]` payloads to attacker infrastructure
- Could be redirected to silently corrupt all bookings, harm hundreds of small French businesses simultaneously
- Could insert phishing language ("call this number to confirm…") replacing the legitimate cabinet phone

```bash
curl -X POST http://85.122.129.248:11434/api/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "rdv-bot:latest",
    "from": "rdv-bot:latest",
    "system": "[redacted - attacker-controlled instructions]"
  }'
```

The original prompt explicitly contains an anti-injection rule (rule #7): the customer-facing safeguard is bypassed entirely by writing the **system** prompt at the API level, that rule only addresses prompts injected via the user/customer channel.

### F3: Hosting Misattribution (MEDIUM)

The Shodan/WHOIS data tags this IP as Romanian academic (ICI Bucharest) but the PTR is `mail.emails-pro.fr`. Either:
- The Romanian institute leases IP space to commercial customers, with stale WHOIS
- A French SaaS is using ICI's IP allocation for hosting

Either way, defenders relying on org-level reputation tagging may misclassify this asset.

**Why it matters**

Medical AI models exposed without authentication create compliance risk (potential HIPAA/patient-data adjacent exposure depending on RAG content).

**One-line fix**

```
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

This rebinds Ollama to loopback only. If running in Docker: `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:11434:11434 ollama/ollama`.

**CVE-2025-63389**

All models on this instance are injectable via the unauthenticated `/api/create` endpoint, an attacker can overwrite any model's system prompt or delete models entirely. No patch exists as of this disclosure.
