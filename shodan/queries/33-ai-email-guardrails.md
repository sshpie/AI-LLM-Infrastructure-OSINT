# 33. AI Email Guardrails (outbound LLM-generated email safety)

_Section created: 2026-06-06. Companion to [§24](24-llm-safety-guardrail-policy.md) (general guardrails / policy engines). This section covers the **outbound-mail-layer** AI safety class: products that sit between an AI agent and the recipient inbox, scanning every LLM-drafted email for PII, prompt-injection-echo, hallucinations, tone, policy violations, and rate-limit / loop pathologies before delivery._

The category is distinct from classic AI-for-email-security (Abnormal, Sublime, Material, Avanan, Proofpoint+Tessian, Cloudflare Email Security/Area 1) which is **inbound** phishing detection at the inbox. This category is **outbound** LLM-output guardrails at the MTA or REST API layer, addressed at agentic-mail use cases.

| Subclass | Examples | Deployment mode | Shodan visibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MTA-layer relay guardrails** | Sluice (Haraka relay + REST API) | Hosted SaaS, customer SMTP-points-here | Direct on the relay node (port 587/465) + cert SAN |
| **API-layer agent guardrails** | AegisAI, Prompt Security email connectors | SaaS API | Indirect (caller-side dorks against apps) |
| **Agent-side safety bouncers** | BeeSafe AI (YC), Salus (YC W2026) | SaaS / sidecar | Indirect |
| **General LLM guardrails repurposed for email** | Lakera Guard, Guardrails AI, NeMo Guardrails | Mixed | See §24 |

**Methodology lesson (carried from §24):** brand-name single-word body matching is noisy. "Sluice" alone matches sluice gates, sluice boxes, hydraulic engineering content. Conjunctive matching required: brand + tagline + endpoint signature.

**Survey status:** **first platform CONFIRMED 2026-06-06 (Sluice).** Three sibling candidates queued. This file logs every dork executed against the category with hit count and date; zero-result dorks are kept.

---

## 1. Sluice (sluice.email)

CONFIRMED 2026-06-06. Single canonical hosted instance on `204.168.138.213` (Hetzner Helsinki, Haraka MTA in Docker Compose). Operator: sluice.email, registered 2026-03-11 via Ascio DK. See [`platforms/sluice.json`](../../../tome/platforms/sluice.json) and case study `case-studies/commercial/sluice-ai-email-guardrails-2026-06-06.md` (pending).

| Shodan Query | Notes |
|---|---|
| `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"sluice.email"` | Cert-SAN anchor (highest specificity). |
| `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"app.sluice.email"` | App-cert anchor. |
| `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"smtp.sluice.email"` | SMTP-cert anchor (smtp subdomain is NOT Cloudflare-proxied, so directly visible). |
| `http.html:"AI email safety layer"` | Tagline meta-description match. |
| `http.html:"AI email safety layer" http.title:"Sluice"` | Conjunctive brand + tagline. |
| `http.favicon.hash:-2070047203` | Favicon mmh3 of the Sluice app icon. |
| `port:587 "Nice to meet you" "sluice"` | Haraka greeting + brand string on submission port. |
| `"sluice-nginx-1.sluice_default"` | Docker Compose service+network leak in EHLO greeting. |
| `port:465 "You talk too soon"` | Haraka `early_talker` plugin signature; combine with brand. |

Operator hardening posture: Cloudflare front on web, HSTS preload, locked CSP, current OpenSSH 9.6p1, Let's Encrypt E7 fresh. **No probing past banner-grab.**

---

## 2. AegisAI (aegisai.ai)

Sibling candidate. CONFIRMED public footprint, **not yet enumerated.** "Agentic AI email security platform": closest naming/positioning to Sluice.

| Shodan Query | Notes (run-pending) |
|---|---|
| `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"aegisai.ai"` | Cert anchor. |
| `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"app.aegisai.ai"` | App-cert anchor. |
| `http.html:"AegisAI" http.html:"email"` | Brand + topic. |

---

## 3. Prompt Security (prompt.security)

Broader GenAI runtime platform; **email connectors are part of the surface.** Inbound-policy SaaS, not MTA relay. Sibling-adjacent. Not yet enumerated.

| Shodan Query | Notes (run-pending) |
|---|---|
| `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"prompt.security"` | Cert anchor. |
| `http.html:"prompt.security"` | Body reference. |

---

## 4. BeeSafe AI (YC) / Salus (YC W2026)

Frontier social-engineering / agent-side safety. Possibly relevant. Footprint sparse. Not yet enumerated.

---

## Discovery dorks (open-ended, for finding NEW platforms in this class)

| Query | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `port:587 "Nice to meet you"` | All Haraka MTAs (broad, ~thousands). Filter against `dnsbl`, `relay`, `email-safety`, `guardrails` in nearby fields. |
| `port:587 "Nice to meet you" "_default"` | Haraka behind docker-compose (project_default network leak in EHLO). |
| `ssl:"AI email safety"` | Cert subject containing the phrase. |
| `http.html:"guardrails for AI-generated email"` | Sluice tagline; would also catch any clone. |
| `http.html:"safety layer for"` `http.html:"agent"` `http.html:"email"` | Conjunctive thematic search for similar pitches. |
| `product:"Haraka"` `port:587` | Haraka MTAs at scale; useful seed list. Cross-reference with TLS cert org field. |

---

## Population estimate

| Class | Estimated public instances | Source |
|---|---|---|
| MTA-layer outbound guardrails (Sluice-class) | **1 confirmed** (Sluice); category is emerging | this survey |
| API-layer outbound guardrails | unknown; SaaS, indirect | category-adjacent §24 |
| General Haraka MTAs (broad seed) | several thousand | Shodan `product:"Haraka"` |

The category is **net-new as of 2026-06-06** for . Sluice is platform 1.

---

## Codified Insight Candidate

★ **Insight (candidate, pending number):** Docker Compose project leak via Haraka default EHLO greeting. Haraka's stock greeting is "Nice to meet you, $HELO". When the operator's `HELO` is left at the container hostname, EHLO leaks `<service-name>-1.<compose-project>_<network>`: exposing both the Compose project name (operator's internal product name) and the service name. Useful for cert-pivot and operator attribution. Mitigation: set Haraka `host_list` or `outbound.local_hostname` to a public-facing identity. The same class of leak likely exists for Postfix `mydestination` defaults and Exim banner default.

## Lane B platoon additions (2026-06-07)

Three-lane Phase 3B dispatch. Lane B covers API-gateway / bearer-token guardrails. New platform JSONs written to `~/tome/`: lakera-guard, prompt-security, aegisai. Sluice already owned by Lane A; not duplicated. Salus YC W2026 vendor unreachable: salus-ai.com resolves to an unrelated Italian medication-management product (Salus AI by Designed for Life), MX = Outlook. Lane C/D platoons should not assume salus-ai.com is the YC vendor apex; the correct apex is not yet identified.

### Lakera Guard

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl:"lakera.ai"` | Cert-based vendor-surface enumeration. |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"api.lakera.ai"` | Production API edge only. |
| version | `http.html:"Lakera Guard"` | Marketing-string detection on platform pages. |

Marker probe: `POST https://api.lakera.ai/v1/guard` with empty JSON returns HTTP 400 with body containing `docs.lakera.ai/docs/api`. That literal IS the fingerprint anchor. Population pivots: 4-region API edge (eu-west-1, us-east-1, us-west-2, ap-southeast-1), each with `-internal` AWS-private siblings; LiteLLM in path at litellm-eu / litellm-us.

### Prompt Security

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl:"prompt.security"` | Cert-based vendor surface (BYOS deployments included). |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"prompt.security"` | Tighter to vendor-issued certs. |
| version | `http.html:"prompt.security" http.html:"protect"` | Marketing + endpoint co-occurrence. |

Marker probe: `GET https://eu.prompt.security/v1/protect` returns HTTP 400 with body `{"status":false,"error":"No api key provided"}`. JSON shape + literal error string IS the fingerprint anchor. Pivot population: 8 region subdomains (eu, eunorth, us-east, apac, apnortheast, apsouth, amxuseast, global) plus BYOS-pattern `byos-<customer>.prompt.security`. Dev cluster surfaces named engineers (yoav-ps.dev, ofek-ps.dev) on 10.66.x.x private space via public DNS: operator OSINT only.

### AegisAI

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl:"aegisai.ai"` | Cert-based surface (CF-fronted SaaS). |
| strict | `http.title:"Aegis AI Console"` | Branded console page literal. |
| version | `http.html:"aegisai" http.html:"Aegis"` | Marketing-string co-occurrence. |

Marker probe: `GET https://console.aegisai.ai/` returns HTML with `<title>Aegis AI Console</title>`. Vendor self-labels as outbound AI-email security; primary-source DNS posture (Google Workspace MX, console-first product surface) refutes: AegisAI is INBOUND. Re-classify in Cat-33 lane taxonomy as misclassified. demo.aegisai.ai gated by GCP IAP (302 `Invalid IAP credentials: empty token`). Staging subdomains expose Langfuse + an internal "phishhook" product.

### Cross-lane dedup notes

- Sluice: Lane A owns the platform JSON. Lane B mode (same API, MTA underneath) does not produce a separate JSON. Pointer in `~/tome/platforms/sluice.json`.
- Salus: Lane B + Lane C overlap. Apex unresolved on this lane. Hand to Lane C platoon: do not assume salus-ai.com is correct; query YC W2026 directory or Crunchbase to resolve the actual product apex before any probe.

### Marker probe insight candidate

The Lakera Guard `POST /v1/guard` and Prompt Security `GET /v1/protect` both return a distinctive error message at HTTP 400 without authentication. This is a deliberate vendor design choice: the API leaks its own identity to support customer integration debugging, while denying any oracle behavior. The error-string-as-banner is the cheap-fingerprint surface for the entire API-gateway guardrail lane. Hypothesis to confirm against a third vendor: the lane has a structural fingerprint pattern, not just per-vendor markers. Pending confirmation as Insight candidate (next number) after a third lane-B vendor probe lands.

## Lane D platoon additions (2026-06-07): SDK / Wrapper guardrails (OSS-heavy)

Lane D targets are mostly OSS frameworks. The dorks below select the DEPLOYMENT side (operators running the OSS publicly), not the FRAMEWORK adoption (operators using it in-process). Population-substitution risk is high; noted per target. Names ARE the finding -- no record reads. Tome platform JSONs written: `~/tome/platforms/llamafirewall.json`, `openguardrails.json`, `invariant-gateway.json`. LiteLLM JSON pre-existed; Lane D mode is a delta noted in the summary, not a re-survey of Cat-05.

### LlamaFirewall (Meta OSS)

Framework, not service. No native network port. Only deployment-mode dorks are useful.

| Tier | Shodan Query | Hit count (2026-06-07) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| basic | `http.html:"LlamaFirewall"` | pending | Catches any wrapper UI / docs mirror; high false-positive (any page citing the paper) |
| strict | `http.html:"LlamaFirewall" "PromptGuard"` | pending | Conjunctive; selects deployments that surface scanner names |
| version | `http.html:"llamafirewall" http.html:"AlignmentCheck" http.html:"CodeShield"` | pending | All three scanner names present -> high-confidence deployment |

Population substitution: operators self-select. The framework is a Python import; visible deployments are a thin-wrapper minority that already invested in shipping it as a service.

### OpenGuardrails

Framework AND deployment (docker-compose ships a public-facing platform with admin UI). Distinctive ports.

| Tier | Shodan Query | Hit count (2026-06-07) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| basic | `http.html:"OpenGuardrails"` | pending | Brand string in landing/admin UI |
| strict | `http.html:"Zero Trust Firewall for AI Agents"` | pending | Tagline; high specificity |
| version | `http.html:"openguardrails-platform" port:54321 product:"PostgreSQL"` | pending | Compose default Postgres host-mapping leaks |
| pivot | `tcp.port:58002 "vllm"` | pending | vLLM serving OpenGuardrails-Text-2510 |

Population substitution HIGH. Brand dork selects operators who exposed the frontend; port-54321 dork selects operators who left compose defaults. Different subsets that overlap but are not the same.

### Invariant Gateway

Self-hosted exposes 8005:8000. SaaS variant (explorer.invariantlabs.ai) is cert-pivot-only.

| Tier | Shodan Query | Hit count (2026-06-07) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| basic | `http.html:"Invariant Gateway"` | pending | Brand string |
| strict | `port:8005 http.html:"invariant"` | pending | Self-hosted compose port |
| version | `http.html:"/api/v1/gateway/"` | pending | Distinctive URL prefix |
| pivot-cert | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"explorer.invariantlabs.ai"` | pending | SaaS users via cert SAN |

Population substitution MEDIUM-HIGH. Self-hosted operators self-select for data-residency rigor; not representative of SaaS-users.

### LiteLLM (policy-mode delta, NOT a re-survey)

Covered as Cat-05 inference gateway. Tome at `~/tome/platforms/litellm.json`. **Lane D delta:** the same proxy, when configured with `guardrails:` in `config.yaml` or via `/guardrails/*` endpoints (registry at `litellm/proxy/guardrails/guardrail_hooks/`), becomes a Lane D wrapper. The Shodan fingerprint does NOT change (still :4000 + `/health/liveliness` + `litellm_version`). What changes is which `guardrail_hooks` are loaded -- invisible to passive enumeration. The hooks directory itself maps the entire Lane D vendor ecosystem in one place: aim, akto, aporia_ai, azure, bedrock, cato_networks, crowdstrike_aidr, custom_code, dynamoai, enkryptai, grayswan, guardrails_ai, hiddenlayer, ibm_guardrails, javelin, lakera_ai (v1+v2), lasso, llm_as_a_judge, mcp_jwt_signer, mcp_security, microsoft_purview, model_armor, noma, onyx, pangea, panw_prisma_airs, pillar, presidio, prompt_security, promptguard, qohash, qualifire, rubrik, semantic_guard, vigil_guard, xecguard, zscaler_ai_guard.

| Tier | Shodan Query (Lane D refinement) | Hit count (2026-06-07) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| pivot | `port:4000 "litellm_version"` cross-reference active `/guardrails/list` | pending | Active probe required to distinguish gateway-mode from guardrail-wrapper-mode |
| CVE | CVE-2026-40217 affects `/guardrails/tests` endpoint -- custom-code sandbox-escape | n/a | The guardrail USER is the attacker; affects 1.74.x to 2026-04-08 |

Population substitution: LiteLLM dork measures gateway population. Lane D subpopulation (guardrail-mode operators) is invisible without active `/guardrails/list` probe.

### Cascade and Galini (skipped per brief)

- **Cascade (cascade.dev)** -- domain returns an unrelated AmazonS3-hosted 1.2KB landing page (verified 2026-06-07 HTTP 200, content-length 1263, x-amz-server-side-encryption set). No relation to a YC W2026 guardrails-and-testing company. Stealth or pivoted. **Skipped.**
- **Galini (galini.ai)** -- parent brief line 286 reclassifies as a **consulting firm**, not a product. Removed. **Skipped.**

### Codified observation -- Lane D dork-population-substitution pattern (Insight candidate)

All four covered frameworks share a structural property: **the dork that selects the framework name selects only the operators who chose to make their deployment publicly visible**. Operators using the same framework as an in-process library are invisible. This is the dork-population-substitution risk (reference-dork-population-substitution) applied to the OSS-framework class. Conclusions about adoption based on dork counts are biased by deployment-style self-selection. Treat hit counts as "publicly-visible-wrapper operators," not "framework users." Insight candidate: the OSS-framework dork population is structurally a different population than the OSS-framework user population, by a self-selection mechanism that biases toward operators who already invested in shipping it as a service.

## 5. Lane C platoon -- Inbox Agent / Workspace addon middleware (2026-06-07)

Targets: Clawvisor (clawvisor.com, YC 2026 OSS), Alter (alterauth.com / alterai.dev marketing, YC W2026), Salus (usesalus.ai, YC W2026 -- apex correction). Lane C vendor summary: `data/platform-intel/cat33-lane-c-vendors-2026-06-07.md`. Tome JSONs: `tome/platforms/clawvisor.json`, `tome/platforms/alter.json`, `tome/platforms/salus.json`.

### Clawvisor

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"clawvisor.com"` | Cert-SAN anchor. |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"clawvisor.com" http.html:"AI Agent Gatekeeper"` | Conjunctive brand + tagline. |
| version | `http.html:"AI Agent Gatekeeper" http.html:"Policy-based access control"` | Tagline-only (any CN). |
| self-host | `port:25297 http.title:"Clawvisor"` | OSS self-host default port (server.port=25297 per config.example.yaml). Matches the operator-warning case -- agents and the gateway sharing a host, internet-exposed. |
| favicon | TBD (pivot pending) | Logo at clawvisor.com web/public/favicon.svg. |

### Alter

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"alterauth.com"` | Real product apex. |
| alt | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"alterai.dev"` | Marketing apex. |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"alterauth.com" http.html:"Alter Vault"` | Conjunctive cert + brand. |
| version | `http.html:"Alter Vault" http.html:"Authorization Layer for AI Agents"` | Tagline anchor. |

### Salus (Lane C absent -- listed for completeness)

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"usesalus.ai"` | Cert-SAN anchor. Apex corrected from salus-ai.com (Italian medication product, refuted by Lane B). |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"usesalus.ai" http.html:"A runtime for agents"` | Conjunctive cert + brand. |
| version | `http.html:"identity.ambiguous_caller" http.html:"Vol. XXI"` | Newspaper-style typography + policy-tag string anchor (the brand "Salus" alone is generic). |

### Lane C population-shape note

None of the three vendors publish a Google Workspace Marketplace or Microsoft AppSource listing detectable via passive scrape (Marketplace SPA hydrates client-side). The Lane C integration shape in this cohort is **per-operator OAuth client registration**, not Marketplace addon. The Workspace-Marketplace dork population is therefore **empty** for this lane -- the right population is cert-SAN + tagline on the vendor's own apex.

### Lane C OAuth scope manifest summary (the actual finding for this lane)

Discipline: scope manifests READ, not exercised. Names ARE the finding.

| Vendor | Gmail scopes requested | MS Graph scopes requested |
|---|---|---|
| Clawvisor | gmail.readonly, gmail.send, gmail.modify, userinfo.email, userinfo.profile | Mail.Read, Mail.Send, Calendars.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite, offline_access |
| Alter | gmail.readonly, gmail.send, gmail.compose, gmail.modify (catalog; operator-selectable) | Mail.Read, Mail.Send, Calendars.Read/ReadWrite, Files.Read/ReadWrite, offline_access (catalog) |
| Salus | n/a (no Workspace integration; product is tool-call proxy) | n/a |

**Restricted-scope finding:** Both Clawvisor and Alter request `gmail.modify`, a Google-classified RESTRICTED scope requiring CASA (Cloud Application Security Assessment) for production. Self-hosted Clawvisor deployments push CASA onto the operator's own GCP project; hosted Clawvisor and Alter carry CASA themselves.

**Microsoft scope finding:** Both expose `Mail.Send + Calendars.ReadWrite + Files.ReadWrite + offline_access` together under a single consent. `offline_access` enables long-lived refresh tokens; if the vendor's credential vault is compromised, refresh tokens permit attacker re-authentication until tenant admin revokes.

### Codified Insight #79 candidate -- Lane C-Cat-33 architecture: per-operator OAuth client, not Marketplace addon

For the AI-agent-authorization-gateway product class in 2026, the operative integration shape is **per-operator OAuth client registration in the customer's own GCP / Azure AD tenant**, not a Workspace Marketplace / AppSource addon. The Lane C platoon found zero detectable Marketplace listings across three target vendors (Clawvisor, Alter, Salus). Verifying this pattern requires:

1. The vendor publishes a docs page titled "Google OAuth Setup" / "Azure AD Setup" walking the operator through their own Cloud Console -- which is exactly what Clawvisor (docs/GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md) and Alter (reference/oauth-providers/google.mdx) ship.
2. The vendor exposes a scope **catalog** that operators select from per integration, not a fixed addon scope set. Clawvisor ships scope sets per adapter; Alter ships a selectable scope set per provider.

Implication for OSINT: the right Lane C dork is cert-SAN on the vendor apex, not Marketplace search. The threat-model surface is the **published scope catalog**, not a Marketplace install count. Confidence: medium (N=3 vendors); track against the next Lane C cohort that emerges.


## Lane D Slice A enterprise security (2026-06-07): hyperscaler + security-vendor guardrails

Lane D Slice A covers 8 enterprise-security vendors whose LiteLLM `guardrail_hooks/` integrations are real (not stubs). All ship as SaaS or hybrid-SaaS; only IBM Guardrails has a self-hosted OSS upstream. Dorks below are designed from the API contract in the LiteLLM source, NOT from Shodan probes. Discipline: cert-pivot on product apex is the primary discovery move for SaaS-only vendors; brand-string body matches are weak when the vendor sits behind Cloudflare / GCP edge / Imperva.

Tome platform JSONs written: `~/tome/platforms/hiddenlayer.json`, `crowdstrike-aidr.json`, `zscaler-ai-guard.json`, `microsoft-purview.json`, `ibm-guardrails.json`, `panw-prisma-airs.json`, `cato-networks.json`, `rubrik-ai-detection.json`.

### HiddenLayer AIDR

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl:"hiddenlayer.ai"` | Product apex cert anchor. |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"api.hiddenlayer.ai"` | API edge CN. |
| version | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"auth.hiddenlayer.ai"` | OAuth2 token endpoint distinguishes from marketing site. |

### CrowdStrike AIDR

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl:"crowdstrike.com"` | Falcon platform apex (broad). |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"api.crowdstrike.com"` | API edge. AIDR is a Falcon module, not a separate apex. |
| version | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"api.us-2.crowdstrike.com"` | Regional cloud (us-2). Population substitution: dork measures Falcon-tenant infra, not AIDR adoption specifically. |

### Zscaler AI Guard

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl:"zseclipse.net"` | Product apex, distinct from zscaler.com corporate apex. |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"api.us1.zseclipse.net"` | Regional API edge. |
| version | `ssl:"envoy-west-lb.zseclipse.net"` | Envoy + AWS ELB backend (k8s-envoygat-* ELB DNS). |

### Microsoft Purview DLP

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl:"graph.microsoft.com"` | Graph API edge -- COVERS ALL M365, not Purview specifically. |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"graph.microsoft.com"` | Identity-pin. |
| version | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"login.microsoftonline.com"` | OAuth2 token endpoint. **Population substitution warning: passive enumeration cannot distinguish a Purview DLP consumer from any other Graph API client.** |

### IBM FMS Guardrails (operator-deployed OSS)

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `http.html:"FMS Guardrails"` | Brand string in operator-deployed detector server or orchestrator. |
| strict | `http.html:"fms-guardrails-orchestrator"` | Upstream repo name as deployment tell. |
| version | `http.html:"/api/v2/text/detection/content"` | Orchestrator-mode API path leak in HTML docs / Swagger. |

### Palo Alto Networks Prisma AIRS

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl:"aisecurity.paloaltonetworks.com"` | Product apex (distinct from prismacloud.io, panorama.paloaltonetworks.com). |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"service.api.aisecurity.paloaltonetworks.com"` | API edge CN. |
| version | `http.headers:"x-pan-token"` | Vendor-specific auth header (NOT Authorization bearer). May 0-result on Shodan body-only HTML scope; route to Censys for header-layer signal. |

### Cato Networks AI Security

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl:"aisec.catonetworks.com"` | Product apex. |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"api.aisec.catonetworks.com"` | API edge CN. Backed by Imperva (impervadns.net). |
| version | `ssl:"catonetworks.com" port:443` | Broader corporate apex; cert-pivot on Cato customer infra. |

### Rubrik AI Detection

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl:"rubrik.com"` | Rubrik Security Cloud apex. |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"*.rubrik.com"` | Customer-tenant subdomains. |
| version | `http.html:"/v1/after_completion/openai/v1"` | Webhook path is distinctive; appears in any operator-side docs / dashboards. |

### Slice A discipline note

For 7 of 8 vendors the integration is SaaS with the vendor running the policy engine. The Shodan-visible population is **the API edge** (Cloudflare / GCP / Imperva / AWS ELB fronted). It is NOT the customer adoption population. Per-customer attribution requires `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"*.{vendor-apex}"` cert-pivot OR `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"{customer-apex}"` reverse-search, NOT brand-body matching at the vendor edge. IBM Guardrails is the lone OSS / self-hosted exception; its dork selects operator deployments and inherits the FRAMEWORK-vs-DEPLOYMENT confound called out earlier in this file.

### Slice A DMARC posture finding

Of 8 vendors, 6 have `p=reject` on the corporate apex (CrowdStrike, Microsoft, IBM, PANW, Rubrik, Zscaler), 1 has `p=quarantine` (Cato), 1 has `p=none` on the product apex (HiddenLayer: `hiddenlayer.ai` is `p=none` even though `hiddenlayer.com` is `p=quarantine`). The HiddenLayer split is the lone weak posture in the cohort -- a security vendor with a product apex below quarantine. Vendor-of-the-vendor distribution: Proofpoint hosts mail for 3 of 8 (CrowdStrike, IBM, PANW); Google Workspace for 3 of 8 (HiddenLayer, Zscaler, Rubrik); Microsoft EOP for 2 of 8 (Microsoft itself, Cato Networks). All 8 use a third-party DMARC aggregator (Proofpoint, Dmarcian, vali.email, everest.email, mxtoolbox) -- none roll their own.

## Lane D Slice C newer/specialized

Long-tail LiteLLM-cataloged guardrail vendors. Mix of real commercial entities (8) and stubs/OSS-wrappers (2).

### DynamoAI (dynamo.ai)

| version | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"onyx.security" http.html:"OnyxGuard"` | brand-in-body |

Side finding: `/guard/evaluate/v1/{api_key}/litellm` puts the API key in the URL path. Any operator HTTP-logging Onyx calls (CDN, WAF, reverse proxy access log) is leaking credentials. Documented OWASP anti-pattern.

### PromptGuard (promptguard.co) -- solo-founder

| Tier | Dork | Note |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"promptguard.co"` | TLS-SAN |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"promptguard.co" http.status:200` | live |
| version | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"promptguard.co" http.html:"PromptGuard"` | brand-in-body |

DMARC ruf attribution: `abhijoysarkar@promptguard.co` (founder).

### Qohash / Qostodian Nexus (qohash.com) -- on-prem appliance

| Tier | Dork | Note |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"qohash.com"` | TLS-SAN (vendor corp) |
| strict | `http.html:"Qostodian"` | product brand body anchor |
| version | `http.html:"Qostodian Nexus" port:8800` | self-hosted appliance on default port |

Note: integration default is `http://nexus:8800` (plaintext, in-cluster). Operator drift to NodePort/LoadBalancer surfaces the appliance.

### Qualifire (qualifire.ai) -- dual-mode SaaS + proxy

| Tier | Dork | Note |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"qualifire.ai"` | TLS-SAN |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"qualifire.ai" http.status:200` | live |
| version | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"qualifire.ai" http.html:"Qualifire"` | brand body |

`proxy.qualifire.ai` reverse-proxy mode = vendor sees all prompt/completion traffic by design.

### CyCraft XecGuard (cycraft.ai) -- Taiwan, AWS CloudFront US edge

| Tier | Dork | Note |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"cycraft.ai"` | TLS-SAN (product subsidiary domain) |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"cycraft.ai" http.html:"XecGuard"` | brand-in-body |
| version | `http.html:"xecguard_v2"` or `http.html:"Default_Policy_SystemPromptEnforcement"` | model id + default policy id |

Side finding: `cycraft.ai` has **no DMARC and no SPF**. Corporate parent `cycraft.com.tw` is the protected domain. The product subsidiary is spoofable -- unusual for an AI-security vendor.

### Semantic Guard -- STUB (LiteLLM built-in, wraps semantic-router OSS)

Not a commercial vendor. Pure in-process Python embedding match against the open-source `semantic-router` library (Aurelio Labs). No vendor apex, no Shodan surface. Dorks: N/A.

### Vigil Guard -- STUB (BYO endpoint, wraps OSS vigil-llm)

Operator-deployed (`VIGIL_GUARD_URL` required, no default). Almost certainly maps to the open-source `deadbits/vigil-llm` project. The Shodan surface is operator-deployed instances, not a vendor apex.

| Tier | Dork | Note |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `http.html:"vigil-llm"` | OSS project brand |
| strict | `http.title:"Vigil" http.html:"prompt injection"` | brand + product purpose |
| version | `http.html:"/v1/guard/analyze"` | route signature |

### Lane D Slice C population-shape note

8 of 10 vendors in this slice are real commercial entities with apex domains. 2 (semantic_guard, vigil_guard) are stubs that wrap open-source projects with no hosted vendor surface. The real-vendor cohort skews early-stage: 4 of 8 vendor apexes are short / non-.com TLDs (.ai/.co/.security) typical of 2023-2024 launches. DMARC enforcement distribution: p=reject 3 (noma, onyx, qohash), p=quarantine 3 (dynamoai, promptguard, qualifire), p=none 1 (enkryptai), no DMARC at all 1 (cycraft.ai product domain). For an AI-SECURITY vendor cohort the enkryptai p=none and cycraft.ai no-DMARC are notable own-house findings.

## Lane D Slice B AI-security startups

Generated 2026-06-07 from LiteLLM `guardrail_hooks/` source for 8 commercial Lane D vendors. Three tiers per vendor (basic = cert anchor, strict = cert + brand, version = body marker). Marker probes verified per Insight #82 against documented public endpoints; no production probing.

### Aporia AI

| strict | `http.html:"guardrails-ai" port:8000` | OSS server default port + brand. |
| version | `http.html:"/guards/" http.html:"validate"` | OSS path anchor; body confirmation requires live find. |

### Javelin

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl:"getjavelin.io"` | Operational apex (NOT javelin.live; that domain has no MX). |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"*.getjavelin.io"` | Wildcard SAN. |
| version | `http.html:"javelin" http.html:"/guardrail/"` | api.javelin.live 301s to api.highflame.app (tenant alias). Probe blocked from sandbox; Insight #82 INCONCLUSIVE. |

### Lasso Security

| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"*.lasso.security"` | Wildcard SAN. |
| version | `http.html:"/gateway/v3/" http.html:"UnauthorizedException"` | NestJS-shaped 401 + path anchor. Insight #82 CONFIRMED-WEAK (framework-default body, vendor-distinctive only paired with /gateway/v3/). |

### Pangea (AI Guard) -- delta-only

| Tier | Dork | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `ssl:"pangea.cloud"` | Cert apex anchor. |
| strict | `ssl.cert.subject.cn:"*.pangea.cloud"` | Wildcard SAN. |
| version | `http.html:"prq_" http.html:"request_id"` | Pangea-branded request_id prefix in 403 body on /v1beta/guard. Insight #82 CONFIRMED. Same surface as Lane B Lakera-adjacency note. |

### Lane D Slice B population-shape note

DMARC + MX cross-reference per Insight #80:

| Vendor | Apex | DMARC | MX | Stage placement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Aporia | aporia.com | p=quarantine | Google | Series B |
| Aim Security | aim.security | p=none | Microsoft 365 | Anomaly (well-funded yet p=none) |
| Akto | akto.io | p=quarantine pct=25 | Google | Series A/B transitional |
| Gray Swan | grayswan.ai | p=none | Google | Anomaly (research-prominent yet p=none) |
| Guardrails AI | guardrailsai.com | p=quarantine pct=100 | Google | Series A |
| Javelin | getjavelin.io | p=none | Google | Seed/A |
| Lasso Security | lasso.security | p=reject sp=none | Google | Series B+ (sp=none = subdomain spoofable) |
| Pangea | pangea.cloud | p=reject | Proofpoint | Series C+ |

Insight #80 distribution across the 8: 1 reject (Pangea), 1 reject-with-sp-none (Lasso), 2 quarantine (Aporia, Guardrails AI), 1 partial-quarantine (Akto), 3 none (Aim, Gray Swan, Javelin). Enforcement rate 50% with 2 anomalies worth flagging (Aim and Gray Swan run p=none despite Series A/B stage indicators).

## Survey run 2026-06-23 — Galileo agent-control + full dork sweep

**Survey date:** 2026-06-23  
**Dorks run:** 43 (all logged in `shodan/query-log.md`)  
**Findings:** 1 HIGH (Galileo agent-control unauth), 1 INFO (Basma Marketing Agent Gateway schema disclosure)  
**Working dir:** `shodan/cat-33-email-guardrails-2026-06-23/`

### Galileo agent-control

New platform discovered via OSINT (YC-adjacent AI safety ecosystem research). Agent-control is Galileo's runtime guardrail engine -- the component that intercepts AI agent actions and enforces policy before execution. Default dev config ships with auth off.

| Tier | Dork | Hit count (2026-06-23) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| strict | `port:8000 http.html:"Runtime Guardrails for AI Agents"` | 1 | Single confirmed instance: 13.68.189.140 (Azure East US). This is the canonical dork. |
| generic | `http.title:"Agent Control"` | 84 | FP-heavy: 71 dead, 2 non-Galileo products (AAPPLIFY, Basma). Only 1/84 is Galileo. Retire this dork. |
| secondary | `port:8000 http.html:"customer-support-agent"` | 1 | 34.57.26.77 -- dead at verify (stale Shodan cache). |

**FINDING:** 13.68.189.140:8000 -- Galileo agent-control v0.1.0, zero auth, full read/write API, Azure East US. See case study: `case-studies/commercial/galileo-agent-control-unauth-2026-06-23.md`.

aimap fingerprint added (body_contains "Runtime Guardrails for AI Agents" on /). Anchors to root-path SPA text, not the generic /health response.

### Platform landscape note (2026-06-23)

Cat-33 Shodan surface is structurally thin. Most vendors bind to loopback or are pure SaaS APIs:
- Clawvisor: host=127.0.0.1 default (documented). Zero public surface.
- Alter, Salus: pure SaaS APIs. Zero self-hosted surface.
- LlamaFirewall: library only, no server process.

The one discoverable finding class is **misconfigured dev deployments** (auth-off, publicly bound). This is "developer left the server running," not a vendor-ships-auth-off pattern. Auth-on-default thesis: CONFIRMED for Cat-33 production deployments.

**Dork quality note:** `http.title:"Agent Control"` produces an 84-hit population with 4% liveness and 1.3% Galileo match. Retired. The precise anchor (`"Runtime Guardrails for AI Agents"`) has 100% precision at 1 confirmed result.
