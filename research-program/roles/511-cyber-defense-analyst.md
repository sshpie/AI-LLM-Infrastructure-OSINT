## Research-program relevance

Directly relevant — and the mirror role to 's external assessment posture. 511 sits inside the org watching the same network traffic  generates from the outside. Tasks T0023 (characterize anomalous traffic), T0297 (identify apps/OS from network traffic), T0299 (identify network mapping and OS fingerprinting activities) are exactly what *should* detect aimap/jaxen probes. When  tradecraft stays quiet (slow probes, congestion-controlled, fingerprint-only), it is calibrated against this role's detection capability set (K0046 IDS methodologies, K0058 traffic analysis, S0156 packet analysis). When VisorRoam ships, it becomes the internal-side equivalent of a 511 sensor for AI/ML infrastructure. Disclosure recipients at orgs with mature SOCs route  findings through a 511 before they reach a 461.
