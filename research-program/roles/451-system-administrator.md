## Research-program relevance

Directly relevant. 451 SysAdmin is the most common operator behind an exposed unauth AI/ML service in 's findings — they stood up the Ollama instance, the Jupyter server, the MLflow tracking host, the Kubernetes node — and missed the auth-on-default toggle. Tasks T0136 (baseline security) and T0144 (account/access management) frame the controls that should have prevented the exposure; their absence in deploy practice is the structural condition 's research program documents. K0167 (system hardening) and S0158 (OS administration) define the defender capability set we're measuring the gap against. Disclosure copy on misconfigured infra typically lands in a 451's queue.
