## Research-program relevance

The 622 is the internal counterpart to 's external work on the software side — pen tests new and updated applications (T0266), runs threat modeling (T0038), reviews secure deployment methodologies. When a target organization has a strong 622 function, the AI/LLM exposures we find are typically configuration gaps the assessor didn't have scope to test, not code defects. When a target lacks the 622 function, expect default-credential and missing-auth findings at the application layer. Useful disclosure routing: 622 owns "actionable results" deliverables, so frame findings as remediation steps not just exposure inventories.
