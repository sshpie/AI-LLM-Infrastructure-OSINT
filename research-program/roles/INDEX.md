# NICE Roles — Research Program Mapping

Mapping each NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework role (DoD-8140) to the research-program activities it covers. Source PDFs in `~/Documents/dod-cyber-pathways/`. Detail files in this directory contain extracted Core Tasks (T-IDs), KSAs, Competencies, On/Off Ramps, and a research-program-relevance assessment per role.

## Upstream-causes roles (the source-side of the auth-on-default thesis)

These are the roles whose *omissions or oversights* produce the exposures  surveys discover:

| Role | Why upstream | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| 421 Database Administrator | DB-exposure findings come from operator-side admin gaps | [421-database-administrator.md](421-database-administrator.md) |
| 441 Network Operations Specialist | Operates the network plane  enumerates externally | [441-network-operations-specialist.md](441-network-operations-specialist.md) |
| 451 System Administrator | Most common operator behind unauth AI/ML exposures | [451-system-administrator.md](451-system-administrator.md) |
| 611 Authorizing Official | Senior AO who signs ATOs; risk acceptance authority | [611-authorizing-official.md](611-authorizing-official.md) |
| 621 Software Developer | Builds inference servers / agent platforms; **auth-on-default originates here** | [621-software-developer.md](621-software-developer.md) |
| 632 Systems Developer | HW/OS/SW integration; embedded/multilevel-security weight | [632-systems-developer.md](632-systems-developer.md) |
| 641 Systems Requirements Planner | Requirements upstream; **where auth-on-default gets specified or omitted** | [641-systems-requirements-planner.md](641-systems-requirements-planner.md) |

- [211 Law Enforcement Counterintelligence Forensics Analyst](211-law-enforcement-counterintelligence-forensics-analyst.md) — LE-side; not invoked
- [212 Cyber Defense Forensics Analyst](212-cyber-defense-forensics-analyst.md) — IR handoff role for confirmed incidents
- [221 Cyber Crime Investigator](221-cyber-crime-investigator.md) — LE prosecution-side; not invoked
- [411 Technical Support Specialist](411-technical-support-specialist.md) — Entry-tier IT; foundational
- [431 Knowledge Manager](431-knowledge-manager.md) — Classification taxonomy ownership
- [712 Cyber Instructor](712-cyber-instructor.md) — Future curriculum delivery
- [723 COMSEC Manager](723-comsec-manager.md) — Communications security
- [751 Cyber Workforce Developer and Manager](751-cyber-workforce-developer-and-manager.md) — Workforce-side
- [801 Program Manager](801-program-manager.md) — Program governance
- [802 IT Project Manager](802-it-project-manager.md) — Project execution
- [803 Product Support Manager](803-product-support-manager.md) — Sustainment
- [804 IT Investment Portfolio Manager](804-it-investment-portfolio-manager.md) — Portfolio strategy

## Cross-role meta-observations

From the per-role extraction work (3 parallel agent batches, all 35 pathways indexed):

- **The 611/612/641/651/652 cluster is the upstream governance/architecture chain** whose gaps produce the AI/LLM exposures  surfaces externally. The 612 Security Control Assessor is the closest NICE analog to  work, performed from inside the system boundary.
- **The 521/531 pair is the defender-side response chain** that receives the disclosures. Per-org disclosure outreach typically routes through these roles or the 722 ISSM.
- **The 621/622/632 developer-assessor cluster is the demographic whose default-deployment choices determine the Insight #76 outcome.** Upstream-maintainer disclosure (Langfuse / InfiniFlow / Arize) targets 621-equivalent roles inside those orgs.
- **671 STES and 805 IT Program Auditor are the strongest methodological analogs to 's verification-stage discipline.** Both define T&E rigor we approximate in restraint-bounded outer-1 verification.
- **732 + 731 dyad is the standard route for PII/PHI exposure disclosures.** The Phoenix `/v1/users` finding class routes here when the operator is a US enterprise; LGPD/GDPR jurisdictions route via 731 first.
- **901 Executive Cyber Leadership terminates high-severity escalations.** Some Taiwan MoE / national-edu-infrastructure findings would route through TWCERT/CC to a 901-equivalent role in country.
