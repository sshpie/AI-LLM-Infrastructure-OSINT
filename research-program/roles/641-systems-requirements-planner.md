## Research-program relevance

Upstream of the deploy. The 641 writes the requirements that determine whether the AI/LLM system  later finds exposed was specified with auth-on, network segmentation, and a security CONOPS (T0325) — or specified for "make it work fast". Most  auth-on-default failures trace back to a requirements document the 641 either never wrote or wrote without K0044 cybersecurity baselines. Not directly invoked in active assessments, but useful when reasoning about why a particular exposure exists: the gap is usually in C043 Requirements Analysis, not in the developer's code.
