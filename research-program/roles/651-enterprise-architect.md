## Research-program relevance

The 651 sets the baseline and target architecture — including identity/access management (K0056: PKI, OAuth, OIDC, SAML, SPML).  assessments often find AI/LLM components deployed *outside* the documented enterprise architecture (shadow ML stacks, researcher-spun MLflow/Weaviate). The 651's gap is scope, not skill: their architecture diagram doesn't include the GPU box a data scientist stood up. Useful frame for executive disclosure summaries: "your enterprise architecture does not account for these N components currently exposed." Maps to TOGAF/DoDAF/FEAF (A0008) for federal targets.
