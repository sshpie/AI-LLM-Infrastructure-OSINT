## Research-program relevance

The 652 owns multilevel-security design (T0071, including UNCLASS/SECRET/TS) and decides which security controls live where in the reference architecture. Most relevant in 's defense-contractor and cleared-target work: when an MLflow or vector DB sits outside the segmented enclave it should be inside, the 652 is who'd own the boundary decision. Strong K0264 supply-chain weight aligns with the AI model/dataset provenance attack surface that's growing across the corpus. For commercial targets, 652 work mostly shows up as defense-in-depth gaps between application and network layers — the recurring pattern where auth exists at one layer but not the next.
