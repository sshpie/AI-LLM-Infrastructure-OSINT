## Research-program relevance

Directly relevant. 421 DBA is the operator-side counterpart to 's database-exposure findings. When aimap fingerprints an unauth Weaviate/Qdrant/MongoDB/Redis/Postgres/MLflow backing store and the data layer is reachable, the responsible operator is functionally a 421 (titled DBA, Data Custodian, Data Architect, or Data Security Manager). Tasks T0162 (backup/recovery) and T0305 (config management) frame what *should* have been in place. Additional KSAs K0260/K0261/K0262 (PII/PCI/PHI standards) and K0277 (column/tablespace encryption) are the controls 's findings repeatedly show were skipped at deploy. When drafting disclosure copy that lands cleanly, address it to a 421 audience.
