## Syllabus

The literal `aisecure.github.io_syllabus.pdf` file does not contain syllabus content — it is an HTML 404 ("Page not found · GitHub Pages") saved with a `.pdf` extension, the artifact of a broken URL on aisecure.github.io. The course shape can be reconstructed from the lecture decks and assignment PDFs:

CS 307 ("Modeling and Learning in Data Science") is an undergraduate-level UIUC course taught by Bo Li (with selected lectures by D.A. Forsyth). The arc is foundational ML — classification (nearest neighbors, linear classifiers/SVM, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forests), unsupervised representation learning (dimension reduction, VAE, GANs), sequence/language models (word embeddings, attention, Transformers, BERT, GPT), control (MDPs, RL, imitation learning), and a closing real-world applications lecture that introduces Vision Transformers, Trustworthy ML (adversarial perturbations, stationarity-assumption failure), and POMDPs. Labs use scikit-style problems (e.g. Week 1: leave-one-out cross-val of KNN on a Turkish-raisin dataset). The final project menu (MDP/RL tic-tac-toe, denoising AE on MNIST, or training a 3-layer DNN on MNIST and generating adversarial attacks against it) confirms the security angle is treated as one capstone option, not the through-line — this is intro ML with a Trustworthy-ML capstone, not a dedicated AI-security course despite the `aisecure.github.io` hosting.

### dropbox_CS307_Finals.pdf

**Title:** CS 307 — Final (project specification)
**Authors:** Course material (Bo Li, UIUC)
**Year:** 2022 (May 11 due date)
**Topic tag:** misc
**Summary:** One-page final project handout. Four suggested topics: (1) MDP tic-tac-toe via value/policy iteration, (2) RL tic-tac-toe, (3) denoising autoencoder for MNIST, (4) train a small DNN on MNIST and generate adversarial attacks against it. NeurIPS format, ≥3-page report.
**Relevance to  program:** Topic 4 (DNN + adversarial attack) is the only direct touch point with our threat-class taxonomy — the canonical undergraduate entry into evasion attacks against image classifiers.

### dropbox_cs307-real.pdf

**Title:** CS 307 Real-World Applications (Vision Transformer; Trustworthy ML; RL/POMDP)
**Authors:** Bo Li (course material)
**Year:** 2022
**Topic tag:** adversarial (mixed — also covers ViT and POMDPs)
**Summary:** 69-page capstone deck stitching three real-world ML topics together. Section 1 is a Vision Transformer walkthrough (patch tokenization, class token, positional embeddings, MLP head) with CIFAR-10/100 benchmarks comparing ViT, Hybrid ViT, ResNet34, and pretrained ViT. Section 2 ("Trustworthy ML") is the security content — adversarial environments around TensorFlow/PyTorch/H2O/AWS ML, the perils of the stationary-data assumption, and the adversarial perturbation formulation max_ε J(θ, x+ε, y) solved via local search / combinatorial opt / convex relaxation. Section 3 covers reinforcement learning and POMDPs.
**Relevance to  program:** Threat class enabling LLM03/LLM04 lineage — establishes the classical adversarial-perturbation framing for inference-time evasion that later evolved into prompt-injection and jailbreaking against LLMs. Useful as background for any case study discussing evasion vs. extraction vs. poisoning taxonomy.

**Relevance to  program:** Not directly relevant — pure RL foundations.

## Lecture videos (skipped from indexing)

- 19-Jan-22.mp4 (~196MB)
- 21-Jan-22.mp4 (~203MB)

- 28-Jan-22.mp4 (~267MB)
- Class-29-April.mp4 (~128MB)

These are the live-lecture recordings; January videos almost certainly cover the early foundations decks (classification, KNN, linear classifiers); the April 29 video corresponds to the `MDPS-RL429` deck (Learning to Control). Not transcribed for this index.

## Topic distribution

Of 13 indexed PDFs: 11 are pure ML foundations (classification, KNN, linear/SVM, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forests, dimension reduction, VAE/GAN, word embeddings/attention/Transformers/BERT/GPT, MDP/RL/imitation x2, the Week-1 lab), 1 (`dropbox_cs307-real.pdf`) is mixed — Vision Transformer + Trustworthy ML + RL/POMDP — and is the only deck containing the adversarial-perturbation formulation, and 1 (`dropbox_CS307_Finals.pdf`) is the final-project handout, misc, whose topic #4 (DNN + adversarial attacks on MNIST) is the only other adversarial touch point. There are 0 papers in this corpus on extraction, model inversion, membership inference, data poisoning, backdoor / Trojan attacks, watermarking, differential privacy, or LLM-specific threats (prompt injection, jailbreaking, RAG poisoning). The course title — "Modeling and Learning in Data Science" — is the honest one; "aisecure" in the GitHub Pages slug overstates the security content, which is one capstone deck and one final-project option. For  threat-class taxonomy work, only `dropbox_cs307-real.pdf` (adversarial perturbation lineage) and `dropbox_CS307_Finals.pdf` (the MNIST-adversarial project prompt) are directly cite-worthy; the rest are useful only as foundational ML background context.
