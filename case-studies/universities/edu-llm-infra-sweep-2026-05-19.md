# .edu LLM Infrastructure Dork-Map — Stage 0 Sweep

_, 2026-05-19. Sub-survey of Session 24._

## TL;DR

The repo's 1,629-dork verified Shodan catalog (29 categories, hand-curated and FP-tested across 50+ prior commercial surveys) was scoped to `hostname:.edu` and run through `shodan count` (free per query, no scan credit). After dropping 45 dorks that already had a `hostname:` filter, **1,584 scoped queries** ran in 48 minutes with a 1.2s rate-limit. **382 dorks (24%) returned ≥1 hit**, 1,143 returned 0, 59 errored (~3.7% rate-limit blip). The data-mapping output establishes which platform classes have material `.edu` exposure surface, what populations to expect at Stage 1 verify, and which dork classes are productive vs noise on the academic surface.

The session-5 university survey (2026-05-03) found 252 JupyterHub instances on `.edu` via a single dork. This Stage 0 catches the same population plus 36 other productive JupyterHub-related dork variants and the entire LLM tier (Ollama, Open WebUI, LiteLLM, n8n, Dify, Streamlit, etc.) that session 5 missed because it stopped after Ollama/Open WebUI/JupyterHub.

## Methodology

**Source dorks:** parsed every backtick-wrapped query line from the 29 `shodan/queries/*.md` files in this repo. Each is a hand-verified dork from a prior commercial survey, with hit-count notes and FP-trap documentation already in place.

**Scope filter:** appended ` hostname:.edu` to each dork. Dorks already containing `hostname:` (45 of 1,629) were dropped to avoid filter conflicts.

**Execution:** `shodan count` per scoped dork, 1.2s sleep between queries, 50-min hard deadline. Output captured as `count<TAB>category<TAB>scoped_dork`.

**Rate-limit empirical data:** an earlier per-university burst sweep at 0s delay produced 62% ERRs (~165/264). At 1.2s delay this sweep produced 3.7% ERRs (~59/1,584). Sustained Shodan freelance-tier rate is ~50 queries/min per API key — empirical, useful for sizing future sweeps.

**No subagent parallelization** for the count phase: Shodan's per-key throttle is the bottleneck, not local concurrency.

**Observation:** `.edu` is dominated by **notebooks (Jupyter), data substrate (PostgreSQL/MongoDB/Redis/Elasticsearch/OpenSearch), observability (Grafana), and the core LLM frontend tier (Ollama/Open WebUI/n8n/LiteLLM/Streamlit)**. Universities do NOT (publicly) run RAG framework servers, image-generation servers, GPU-compute exporters, or backup/snapshot services at meaningful population on `.edu` hostnames — those categories had 0 productive dorks. Most of those surface on commercial cloud (AWS/Azure) infra instead.

## Noise observations (Insight-class)

1. **`org:"Airtable, Inc" port:443 hostname:.edu` returned 46,444** — the highest hit count of any single dork in the sweep. This is **NOT 46K Airtable-hosted university apps**; it's Shodan facet-combinatorial: customer `.edu` domains pointing at Airtable's IPs, where the customer's `.edu` ends up in Shodan's hostname index but the actual host is Airtable. Discarded from the LLM-tier table. **Class:** SaaS-customer-CNAME noise; mirrors the `org:"Cloudflare"` problem in commercial surveys.

2. **`port:4444 hostname:.edu` returned 1,672** — Selenium Grid default port, but `.edu` campus networks routinely run port 4444 for many non-Selenium services (krb524 in particular). The cat-21 browser-agents subset of this is a real signal at much smaller population; will need conjunctive verify to extract.

3. **`http.html:".co" hostname:.edu` returned 1,104** under cat-24-llm-safety-guardrail-policy — substring match on the `.co` TLD as a body string. Generic FP class, drop.

4. **PostgreSQL/MongoDB/Redis/OpenSearch returning 1007/170/118/476** — universities run lots of data-tier infra publicly. Not LLM-specific by themselves, but pre-Insight: when colocated with a confirmed Ollama/Open WebUI/Jupyter host, these are the Pharos-class shadow-port findings to look for (per [Insight #11/#12](../../methodology/insight-12-ip-shadow-colocation.md)).

## Dork-class hierarchy on `.edu`

Confirming this session's earlier [Insight #45](../../methodology/insight-45-niche-dork-class-hierarchy.md) at the academic scope:

| Class | Example | `.edu` population |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontend-bundle-ID body** | `http.html:"jupyter"` | 800 |
| **Bundle-ID body alt** | `http.html:"jupyterhub"` | 297 |
| **Server-header banner** | `http.html:"Ollama is running"` | 87 |
| **Product facet** | `product:Ollama port:11434` | 83 |
| **Title** | `http.title:"Jupyter"` | 539 |
| **Default-port facet** | `port:8501` (Streamlit) | 167 |
| **JSON-config body** | `http.html:"Chainlit"` | 11 |
| **Route-slug body** | `http.html:"/hub/login"` | 171 |

Title and bundle-ID body are the highest-yield on `.edu`. Server-header banners under-represent because the `.edu` Ollama population is dominated by older versions that pre-date the `Server: ollama` header (added v0.5+).

## Carry-forward — Stage 1 (next)

This case study captures **Stage 0 only** — the dork-mapping output. Stages 1–4 are pending:

**Stage 1:** Per high-yield dork (≥3 hits), `shodan download --limit N` to pull sample IPs. ~100 dorks × avg 50 hosts = ~5K sample tuples to verify.

**Stage 2:** Inline-probe verify per platform-class (proven 21s/1000-host asyncio pattern from this session's earlier `.edu` work). Drop substring-FP candidates per Insight #15.

**Stage 3:** Hostname → institution attribution via the local `world_universities_and_domains.json` (2,349 US institutions with `.edu` domains). Suffix-match `gpu.cs.example.edu` → `Example University`.

**Stage 4:** Diff confirmed hosts against the 81 existing case studies (49 cross-validated institutions per `known-from-overview.tsv`). Surface NEW institutions only. Per-institution case study files under `US/` and `international/`.

**Optional Stage 5:** Disclosure routing decisions (Cowboy's call, per `feedback_no_disclosure_recommendations`).

## Toolchain provenance

```
Stage 0 — index ~/AI-LLM-Infrastructure-OSINT/shodan/queries/*.md → 1,629 verified dorks
         → drop dorks with existing hostname: filter → 1,584 scoped dorks
         → shodan count per dork, 1.2s rate-limit, 50-min deadline
         → scoped-counts.tsv (382 non-zero rows of 1,584)
```
