# Purdue University (main campus): Account Takeover on n8n Workflow Automation Server

_ · 2026-05-03_

## Summary

Purdue University main campus (West Lafayette, IN) exposes an Ollama instance at `n8n.tap.purdue.edu`, the reverse DNS reveals this is a Purdue n8n workflow automation deployment. n8n is a self-hosted AI workflow tool that connects LLMs to internal databases, APIs, and services. The Ollama instance feeds AI capabilities to the n8n workflow engine; account takeover credentials are exposed via the cloud proxy 401 response. Any AI-powered workflow automation at Purdue running through this instance can be hijacked via model injection.

This is distinct from the existing Purdue Northwest finding (`IN-purdue-northwest.md`), this is Purdue's main West Lafayette campus.

## Infrastructure

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| IP | 128.210.38.15 |
| rDNS | `n8n.tap.purdue.edu` / `docs.tap.purdue.edu` |
| Org | Purdue University |
| Campus | West Lafayette, IN (main campus) |
| Ollama version | 0.12.3 |
| Open port | 11434 (public, no auth) |

The `n8n.tap.purdue.edu` hostname confirms this server runs n8n, a self-hosted workflow automation platform commonly used to build AI pipelines connecting LLMs to databases, APIs, email, and enterprise systems. `docs.tap.purdue.edu` on the same IP suggests this is a TAP (Technology Assistance Program?) infrastructure node with both documentation and workflow automation services.

## Findings

### F1: Account Takeover on Workflow Automation Server (CRITICAL)

The exposed Ollama instance is co-located with `n8n.tap.purdue.edu`. n8n workflows that call the local Ollama endpoint will receive attacker-controlled responses after model injection via CVE-2025-63389. The impact is not limited to the LLM itself, any automated workflow action triggered by AI output (database writes, API calls, email sends, report generation) becomes attacker-influenced. This extends the attack surface beyond model inference into every downstream system n8n is connected to.

### F2: Cloud Proxy Account Hijack (CRITICAL)

401 response exposes the Ollama Connect public key. Account takeover allows the attacker to:
- View all cloud model usage/billing on this account
- Revoke or reassign cloud model access
- Redirect cloud proxy traffic to attacker-controlled endpoints

### F3: CVE-2025-63389 Model Injection (CRITICAL)

All models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`. On an n8n-connected Ollama instance, a single injection propagates into any workflow that calls the affected model.

## Remediation

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

n8n should be configured to connect to `127.0.0.1:11434` only. If running in Docker, use internal Docker networking (do not bind Ollama to host port).
