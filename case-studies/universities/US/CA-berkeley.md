## Summary

`lal-99-178.reshall.berkeley.edu` (169.229.99.178), a machine on UC Berkeley's residential hall network, runs Ollama v0.11.10 with `qwen2.5:32b` (19GB) exposed on port 11434. The `reshall.berkeley.edu` subdomain indicates student on-campus housing infrastructure. A student machine in a residential dorm running a 19GB model publicly accessible from the internet.

## Findings

### F1: Residential Hall Machine with Internet-Exposed Inference (HIGH)

The `reshall.berkeley.edu` subdomain places this machine in student-facing residential hall infrastructure, likely a personal workstation or lab machine belonging to a graduate student or researcher. Running `qwen2.5:32b` (19GB weights) indicates significant local hardware (high-VRAM GPU).

Berkeley's residential network should not expose port 11434 to the public internet. This represents a misconfiguration at either the network layer (no egress/ingress filtering on student housing ports) or the host level (Ollama bound to 0.0.0.0 instead of loopback). The `lal` prefix is unresolved, could be a lab allocation within the residential network.

### F2: v0.11.10: ~1.5-Year-Old Ollama (HIGH)

v0.11.10 dates to approximately late 2024. CVE-2025-63389 injectable.

### F3: CVE-2025-63389 (HIGH)

`qwen2.5:32b` injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`.

## Remediation

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

Berkeley network team should audit residential hall egress for port 11434 exposure.
