# Rochester Institute of Technology: 4-Node Cluster, DGX with 18 Cloud Subscriptions, Student Machine with Abliterated Models

_ · 2026-05-01_

---

## Summary

Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) has four externally-accessible Ollama nodes on campus, including an NVIDIA DGX research server with 18 cloud proxy subscriptions (same subscription portfolio as POSTECH/Shiv Nadar/Hanoi) and a student machine with two abliterated QwQ-32B models alongside an embedding model for a RAG pipeline. All nodes injectable via CVE-2025-63389.

|----------|-----|--------|-------|-------|
| disco-dgx-spark.wireless.rit.edu | 129.21.25.95 | 25 | **18** | NVIDIA DGX GPU server |
| ragdepc.student.rit.edu | 129.21.149.97 | 4 | 0 | **Student machine, abliterated models + RAG** |
| 8N610008D0.ad.rit.edu | 129.21.220.95 | 10 | 1 (deepseek) | AD-joined workstation |

## Node: 8N610008D0.ad.rit.edu (AD Workstation: Cloud Proxy + Account Takeover)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| IP | 129.21.220.95 |
| Hostname | 8N610008D0.ad.rit.edu |
| Models | 10 (1 cloud proxy: deepseek) |

Cloud proxy 401 leaks Ollama Connect credentials:

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "signin_url": "https://ollama.com/connect?name=72e95ec7e5f4&key=<base64>"
}
```

- **Username:** `72e95ec7e5f4`
- **SSH pubkey:** `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMq7cpKDactDR6mE3QWowO3fcW+GaM4HcOSjhbxRtsCN`

Username `72e95ec7e5f4` is a MAC address, matches the AD hostname pattern (8N610008D0), AD-joined Windows machine running Ollama.

## Node: disco-dgx-spark (DGX GPU Server: 18 cloud subscriptions)

Same 18-model cloud portfolio as POSTECH, Shiv Nadar, and Hanoi University:  
DeepSeek (v4-pro, v4-flash, v3.2), MiniMax (m2, m2.1, m2.5, m2.7), Kimi (k2.5, k2.6, k2-thinking), GLM (4.6, 4.7, 5, 5.1), Qwen (3.5, coder-next), Gemini (flash-preview), Nemotron.

Local models: qwen3.6:35b (22GB), qwen3.5:27b (16GB), qwen3-coder-next:latest (48GB), llama3.2:3b, smollm2:135m.

All 25 models injectable via CVE-2025-63389. 18 cloud subscriptions accessible through unauthenticated port.

---

## Node: ragdepc.student.rit.edu (STUDENT Machine: Abliterated + RAG)

| Model | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| qwq:latest | 14 GB | QwQ-32B reasoning model |
| qwq-uncensored:latest | 14 GB | **Abliterated QwQ, safety removed** |
| huihui_ai/qwq-abliterated:32b-Q3_K_M | 14 GB | **Abliterated QwQ, safety removed** |
| nomic-embed-text:latest | 0 GB | **Embedding, RAG pipeline** |

- Hostname prefix `ragdepc` suggests "RAG deep PC", student building a RAG system with abliterated reasoning models
- Two variants of abliterated QwQ-32B publicly accessible on student hardware
- Model injection via CVE-2025-63389 affects any RAG pipeline using these models

---

## Node: cl5.wireless.rit.edu (Wireless Client: uncensored model)

19 models including:
- `llama2-uncensored:7b`, uncensored Llama 2
- `gpt-oss:latest` (12GB), `glm-4.7-flash` (17GB), `lfm2.5-thinking`, `ShreyanGondaliya/s5:latest`
- Multiple qwen3.5 variants, deepseek-coder

---

## Findings

### F1: DGX GPU Server: 18 Cloud Subscriptions Exposed (CRITICAL)

Research-grade NVIDIA DGX server running Ollama with 18 cloud proxy subscriptions, publicly accessible without authentication.

### F2: Student Machine: Dual Abliterated Reasoning Models + RAG (HIGH)

Student's machine running two variants of QwQ-32B with safety fine-tuning removed, alongside an embedding model confirming a RAG pipeline. Both abliterated models and the RAG pipeline are publicly accessible without credentials.

### F3: Third Node: llama2-uncensored on Wireless Client (MEDIUM)

Wireless-connected laptop running `llama2-uncensored:7b` exposed on port 11434.

---

## Pattern Note

The DGX server's 18-model cloud proxy portfolio (DeepSeek + MiniMax + Kimi + GLM + Qwen + Gemini + Nemotron) appears identically at POSTECH (Korea), Shiv Nadar (India), Hanoi University (Vietnam), and now RIT. This suggests a **shared Ollama Connect subscription, demonstration account, or institutional license** distributed across multiple universities.

---

## Remediation

```bash
# All nodes
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

Network perimeter: block TCP 11434 outbound at campus edge.

## Additional hosts (2026-05-19 .edu sweep)

Two more RIT-attributed hosts surfaced during the 2026-05-19 .edu LLM-infra survey wave-2 — `disco-dgx-spark` (multi-service Ollama + Open WebUI on a DHCP-rotated wireless host) and `seappsvr09` (Open WebUI on a software-engineering applications server).

### Host A — `disco-dgx-spark.wireless.rit.edu` (multi-service)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| IP | 129.21.25.95 |
| rDNS | `disco-dgx-spark.wireless.rit.edu` at time of Stage-0 capture; hostname DNS-rotated by wave-2 (DHCP behavior on the `wireless.rit.edu` subnet) |
| Org | Rochester Institute of Technology |
| Hostname semantics | `disco-dgx-spark` — likely DISCO (Distributed Computing) group's DGX-class spark-cluster node |
| Services | Ollama on :11434 + Open WebUI v0.8.7 on :8080 |

**Service A1 — Ollama on :11434**: visorgoose `--tld .edu` scan tagged this host with **29-model inventory + CLOUD + RAG tags**. The CLOUD tag indicates `:cloud`-suffix model entries are present (Ollama configured as cloud-proxy class — same pattern as SDSC and UMaine ECE host). RAG tag indicates an embedding-pipeline model is loaded.

**Service A2 — Open WebUI v0.8.7 on :8080**: Direct probe of `/api/config` via IP returned:

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "name": "Open WebUI",
  "version": "0.8.7",
  "default_locale": "",
  "oauth": {"providers": {}},
  "features": {
    "auth": true,
    "auth_trusted_header": false,
    "enable_signup_password_confirmation": false,
    "enable_ldap": false,
    "enable_api_key": null,
    "enable_signup": false,
    "enable_login_form": true,
    "enable_websocket": true,
    "enable_version_update_check": true
  }
}
```

**Class observed**: Open WebUI auth-on (`enable_signup: false`). The OW UI is presumably the user-facing layer for the Ollama backend on :11434 — typical Ollama+OW deployment pattern. The OW config is closed-enrollment (correct posture); the Ollama backend on :11434 is publicly reachable without auth (Ollama default class).

The notable combination: **OW correctly closed-enrollment AT THE FRONT-DOOR, but Ollama API publicly reachable AT THE BACK-DOOR**. Same compute, two attack surfaces: the UI requires auth, the underlying Ollama doesn't. An attacker bypasses the OW auth layer by calling `:11434` directly.

### Host B — `seappsvr09.se.rit.edu` (Open WebUI v0.8.12)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| IP | 129.21.34.116 |
| rDNS | `seappsvr09.se.rit.edu` (Software Engineering department applications server — server 09) |
| Org | Rochester Institute of Technology |
| Service | Open WebUI v0.8.12 on port 3000 |

**Observations**: `GET .../api/config` returned Open WebUI v0.8.12 with `enable_signup: false`, `enable_login_form: true`, `enable_ldap: false`, `enable_api_key: null`. Properly configured closed-enrollment OW. No special branding.

**Class observed**: Open WebUI auth-on class. Standard institutional-software-eng-dept LLM service.

### Cross-tool confirmations

- aimap wave-2 (`-ports-class wide`) — surfaced both hosts
- visorbishop (post-G5 fix) — Host A and Host B both classified `open-webui auth=auth severity=info`
- visorgoose `.edu` scan — surfaced Host A with 29-model inventory + CLOUD + RAG tags
- Direct `/api/config` probes — verified auth-on independently on both

### Notable details — RIT cohort

RIT now has 6 hosts across multiple departments in the  ledger (4 from earlier survey + these 2 new). Pattern: RIT's DISCO group runs cloud-proxy-class Ollama; SE dept runs auth-on OW. Different operators, different postures, same institution.

The `disco-dgx-spark` hostname rotation between Stage-0 capture and wave-2 verification (the `.wireless.rit.edu` subnet uses DHCP) is a recurring issue for tracking DHCP-assigned institutional hosts. Direct-IP probing (`129.21.25.95:8080` and `:11434`) is the resilient identifier.

### Class-membership summary (no tier labels per survey convention)

- Host A Ollama: cloud-proxy class — OBSERVED (per visorgoose CLOUD tag; 29-model inventory observed)
- Host A Open WebUI: auth-on class — OBSERVED, BUT note the OW-vs-Ollama-backend asymmetry (UI auth-on, backend public)
- Host B Open WebUI: auth-on class — OBSERVED
- RIT multi-host pattern across departments — OBSERVED

Data-membership (specific cloud model invocation, specific Ollama backend exploitation, specific signup attempt) not tested per restraint ethic.
