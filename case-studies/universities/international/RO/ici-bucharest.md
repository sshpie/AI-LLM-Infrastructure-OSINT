# ICI Bucharest: 2-Node Cluster, Cloud Proxy + Abliterated Models

## Summary

Institutul National de Cercetare-Dezvoltare în Informatică (ICI Bucharest), Romania's national IT research institute, exposes two Ollama nodes. Node 1 (85.122.129.92) runs cloud proxy subscriptions (DeepSeek, MiniMax). Node 2 (85.122.129.248) is a large-model compute node with 11 models including abliterated Qwen2.5-Coder, two Dolphin uncensored models, and a custom `rdv-bot` with exposed system prompt, and a 72B Qwen2.5 model.

## Node 1: Cloud Proxy (85.122.129.92)

| Model | Notes |
|---|---|
| deepseek-v4-pro:cloud | DeepSeek V4 Pro via cloud proxy |
| minimax-m2.7:cloud | MiniMax M2.7 via cloud proxy |
| llama3.2:3b | Local |
| llama3:latest | Local |

## Node 2: Large Compute (85.122.129.248)

| Model | Category | System Prompt |
|---|---|---|
| qwen2.5:72b | 72B model | "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud." |
| qwen2.5:14b | 14B model | "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud." |
| qwen2.5:7b-instruct-q4_K_M | 7B model | "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud." |
| huihui_ai/qwen2.5-coder-abliterate:14b | **Abliterated** | "You are a helpful assistant." |
| llama3.1-8b-abliterated:latest | **Abliterated** |, |
| dolphin-llama3:latest | Uncensored | "You are Dolphin, a helpful AI assistant." |
| dolphin-mistral:latest | Uncensored | "You are Dolphin, a helpful AI assistant." |
| rdv-bot:latest | Custom | (see F2) |

## Findings

### F1: Cloud Proxy Quota Exposure (CRITICAL)

Node 1 exposes DeepSeek V4 Pro and MiniMax M2.7 cloud proxy subscriptions without authentication. Any actor can drain ICI Bucharest's API quotas at no cost to themselves.

### F2: rdv-bot System Prompt Leaked (HIGH)

Node 2 hosts a custom `rdv-bot:latest` model. The `rdv-bot` name (Romanian: "rdv" = "rendezvous" / appointment scheduling) suggests a production chatbot, a Romanian scheduling or appointment assistant. Full system prompt accessible via `/api/show`.

### F3: Abliterated + Uncensored Models on Research Infrastructure (HIGH)

`huihui_ai/qwen2.5-coder-abliterate:14b` (safety-removed) and `llama3.1-8b-abliterated` coexist with legitimate research models. Both `dolphin-llama3` and `dolphin-mistral` are uncensored variants. On a national research institute's public-facing IP, these will comply with arbitrary instructions without access control.

### F4: 72B Model for Free Inference (HIGH)

`qwen2.5:72b` accessible without authentication. Frontier-class inference at ICI Bucharest's compute cost.

### F5: Model Injection on Both Nodes (CRITICAL)

CVE-2025-63389 applies to both nodes.
