_ · 2026-05-03_

---

## Summary

A server with hostname `itu.edu.vn` (94.136.191.179) running Ollama on Contabo GmbH VPS infrastructure has a live Ollama Connect account takeover. The hostname references the International University (IU Vietnam) or Binh Duong University domain, indicating a Vietnamese academic operator running cloud-hosted Ollama outside campus infrastructure. The cloud proxy 401 leaks an account claim URL.

## Findings

### F1: Account Takeover via Cloud Proxy 401 (CRITICAL)

MiniMax M2.7 cloud subscription exposed via unauthenticated port. Live claim URL leaks SSH pubkey and account credentials.

### F2: Off-Campus VPS Deployment (MEDIUM)

The server is hosted on Contabo VPS (Germany), not on university infrastructure. The operator moved the Ollama instance to a commercial VPS, likely to avoid university firewall restrictions, bypassing any network-level controls the institution might have had.

### F3: CVE-2025-63389 (HIGH)

v0.13.1. Both models injectable.

---

## Remediation

Rotate Ollama Connect account, restrict port 11434 in Contabo firewall settings.
