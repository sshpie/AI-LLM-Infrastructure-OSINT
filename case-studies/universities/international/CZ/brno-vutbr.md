---

## Summary

Brno University of Technology (VUT Brno), Czech Republic, is running Ollama on a Faculty of Mechanical Engineering server with an abliterated Gemma 3 model (safety fine-tuning removed), two variants of a Bulgarian-language GPT model, and an embedding model indicating an active RAG pipeline. All models are unauthenticated and injectable.

## Findings

**F1, Abliterated Gemma 3 27B (HIGH):** `seamon67/Gemma3-Abliterated` has safety fine-tuning removed. Accessible to any unauthenticated internet caller on a university research server.

**F2, RAG Pipeline Injection Surface (HIGH):** `nomic-embed-text` embedding model confirms an active RAG pipeline. CVE-2025-63389 injection affects document-augmented responses.

**F3, Bulgarian Language Models (MEDIUM):** `todorov/bggpt` is a Bulgarian-language GPT, suggests international research collaboration or researcher with Bulgarian connections. Both variants are publicly accessible.

**F4, Unauthenticated Ollama API (HIGH):** All 8 models injectable via CVE-2025-63389.
