# Waseda University: Account Takeover (`tokoko`), Custom DeepSeek Academic/JP Models, qwen3-vl:235b

## Summary

Waseda University (`tokoko.human.waseda.ac.jp`, 133.9.184.47) exposes Ollama with 10 models including a live Ollama Connect account takeover. The username is `tokoko`, a human-chosen name, not a container ID or MAC address, indicating deliberate (though insecure) account registration. Two custom fine-tuned models are present: `deepseek-r1-70b-academic:latest` and `deepseek-r1-70b-jp:latest`, suggesting internal Waseda research customization of DeepSeek R1 70B for academic and Japanese-language use. Also present: `qwen3-vl:235b` (235B vision-language model) and `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud`.

## Infrastructure

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| IP | 133.9.184.47 |
| Hostname | tokoko.human.waseda.ac.kr |
| Organization | Japan Network Information Center (JPNIC, AS2527) |
| Institution | Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan |
| Department | Human Sciences (`.human.waseda.ac.jp`) |
| Ollama version | 0.13.4 |
| Open port | 11434 (public, no auth) |

## Account Takeover

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "signin_url": "https://ollama.com/connect?name=tokoko&key=<base64>"
}
```

- **Username:** `tokoko`, **human-readable name, deliberately set**
- **SSH pubkey:** `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIJsFYwODwN1Qk5qyciNtJANLeEvm/PIrSTn0Srhuzrq1`

Unlike most takeover targets where the username is an auto-generated MAC address or container ID, `tokoko` was explicitly chosen. The operator consciously registered an Ollama Connect account under this name but left the port publicly accessible.

## Findings

### F1: Deliberate Account Name + Takeover (CRITICAL)

`tokoko` is not auto-generated, it was chosen by the operator. The same person registered the Ollama Connect account, chose a personal username, and left port 11434 bound to 0.0.0.0. The live claim URL means any actor visiting the URL inherits full control over the DeepSeek V4 Pro cloud subscription.

### F2: Custom Waseda Research Models (HIGH)

`deepseek-r1-70b-academic:latest` and `deepseek-r1-70b-jp:latest` are fine-tuned variants of DeepSeek R1 70B. These are internal research artifacts, not published on Ollama Hub under standard names, indicating active NLP research at Waseda's Human Sciences department. Both models are injectable and fully accessible to unauthenticated callers, leaking the existence and outputs of non-public research fine-tunes.

### F3: qwen3-vl:235b Frontier Vision-Language Model (HIGH)

`qwen3-vl:235b` is a 235B-parameter vision-language model. Accessible at Waseda's GPU compute cost, no authentication, no rate limit.

### F4: CVE-2025-63389 (CRITICAL)

v0.13.4. All 10 models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`.

## Waseda Human Sciences Department Context

The `.human.waseda.ac.jp` hostname places this server in Waseda's Faculty/Graduate School of Human Sciences (人間科学部・大学院人間科学研究科). Japanese-language and academic fine-tunes of DeepSeek R1 suggest NLP research involving Japanese text or academic corpus training. The `tokoko` persona name may correspond to a researcher or lab identity.

## Remediation

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

Change Ollama Connect username and rotate SSH key via ollama.com settings.
