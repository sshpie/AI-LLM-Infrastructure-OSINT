## Summary

Technical University of Łódź (Politechnika Łódzka) has an Ollama instance on `xray02.p.lodz.pl` with 3 models including a 20GB DeepSeek-R1 and `lukashabtoch/plutotext-r3-emotional:latest`, the same custom emotional-roleplay model observed independently at CEFET/RJ in Brazil and other nodes, indicating cross-institutional propagation of an obscure community fine-tune.

## Findings

### F1: Cross-Network Model Propagation (MEDIUM)

`lukashabtoch/plutotext-r3-emotional:latest` is a low-citation community fine-tune for emotional roleplay. This exact model appears on at least two geographically unrelated institutions (Łódź, Poland and CEFET/RJ, Brazil) suggesting it propagates through shared Hugging Face download patterns or operator-to-operator social sharing. Uncommon model identifiers like this can serve as Shodan/HTTP banner search correlators for cross-network attribution.

### F2: Unauthenticated Inference on Research Server (HIGH)

`deepseek-r1:32b` (19.9GB, 32.8B params) is accessible without authentication. The hostname `xray02` suggests an X-ray / radiological research compute node, making the exposure pattern consistent with a research GPU being repurposed for LLM workloads without access controls.

### F3: CVE-2025-63389 Injectable (HIGH)

All models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`.
