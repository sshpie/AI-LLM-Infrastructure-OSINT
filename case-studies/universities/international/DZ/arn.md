ARN is Algeria's national research and education network. An exposed Ollama node on this infrastructure indicates individual researcher or institutional deployment without network-level access control.

### F2: Model Injection (CRITICAL)

CVE-2025-63389 applies. Old version (0.9.6) confirms this node has not been updated since early 2024.
