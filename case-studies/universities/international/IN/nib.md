---

## Summary

Two Ollama nodes on India's National Internet Backbone (NIB), operated by BSNL (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited), India's state-owned telecom. Node 2 (`static.ill.117.251.22.196.bsnl.co.in`) runs a 32B coding model alongside DeepSeek-Coder 6.7B, suggesting an active software development or research deployment on national backbone infrastructure.

## Node 2 Models (117.251.22.196)

| Model | System Prompt |
|---|---|
| qwen2.5-coder:32b | "You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant." |
| deepseek-coder:6.7b | "You are an AI programming assistant, utilizing the Deepseek Coder model..." |
| smollm2:135m | "You are a helpful AI assistant named SmolLM, trained by Hugging Face" |
| (4 additional models) |, |

## Findings

### F1: National Backbone Infrastructure Exposed (HIGH)

These nodes sit on BSNL's National Internet Backbone, India's government-owned national IP transit network. AI inference running on national telecom backbone infrastructure, exposed without authentication.

### F2: 32B Coding Model for Free Inference (HIGH)

`qwen2.5-coder:32b` accessible without authentication. The co-deployment with `deepseek-coder:6.7b` and system prompts indicates active coding assistance use, production tooling on public-facing backbone IP.

### F3: Model Injection (CRITICAL)

CVE-2025-63389 applies to both nodes.
