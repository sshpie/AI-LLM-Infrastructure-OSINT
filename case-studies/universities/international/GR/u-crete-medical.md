# University of Crete Medical Center: Dual-Embedding RAG Pipeline

_ · 2026-05-01_

---

## Summary

The University of Crete Medical Center (`centaur.med.uoc.gr`) is running Ollama with a sophisticated dual-embedding RAG pipeline, both `mxbai-embed-large` and `nomic-embed-text` are deployed alongside large language models (Llama 3.3, Qwen3-Coder, Mistral). Dual embedding models indicate a production RAG system over medical/research content, unauthenticated and injectable.

## Findings

**F1, Dual-Embedding RAG Pipeline on Medical Server (CRITICAL):** Two embedding models (mxbai-embed-large + nomic-embed-text) running simultaneously indicates a production RAG system. On a medical university server, the document corpus likely includes medical research, clinical workflows, or patient-facing content. Model injection via CVE-2025-63389 affects all documents served through the RAG pipeline.

**F2, Unauthenticated Medical Research Server (HIGH):** `centaur` suggests an academic/mythological name for a compute node (common at Greek universities). All models accessible without credentials, researchers' document-augmented queries are injectable.

**F3, Model Injection (HIGH):** All 8 models injectable via CVE-2025-63389.

## Context

This is a separate institution from the Technical University of Crete (TUC, 147.27.38.32) documented in GR-tech-crete-ntua.md. University of Crete (UoC) is a public university with a medical school; `centaur.med.uoc.gr` is a named server in the medical faculty.
