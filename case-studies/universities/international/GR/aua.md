## Summary

`afa4pc19.aua.gr` (143.233.187.19), Agricultural University of Athens (Γεωπονικό Πανεπιστήμιο Αθηνών, AUA), runs Ollama v0.18.2 with a 5-model stack anchored by `qwen3:235b-a22b-instruct-2507-q4_K_M`, the Qwen3 235B MoE model (235.1B total params, 22B active, July 2025 instruction variant) at 142GB. A dual-embedding RAG pipeline (BGE-M3 + nomic-embed-text) is running alongside DeepSeek-R1:32B and Llama3.3:70B.

## Findings

### F1: Qwen3 235B: Largest MoE Model on Greek Academic Infrastructure (HIGH)

`qwen3:235b-a22b-instruct-2507-q4_K_M` is a 235.1B parameter mixture-of-experts model, 22B parameters active per inference pass, running on agricultural university hardware. The `2507` tag indicates the July 2025 instruction fine-tune (the most current Qwen3 variant). At Q4_K_M quantization, the 142GB weight file requires significant GPU memory. The "afa4pc19" hostname suggests this is a department workstation (PC #19, AFA department, possibly Applied Forestry, Agricultural Sciences, or similar).

Unauthenticated inference against a 235B MoE constitutes significant compute theft at scale.

### F2: Dual-Embedding RAG Pipeline (HIGH)

Both `bge-m3:latest` (multilingual, 500M+ params) and `nomic-embed-text:latest` are present simultaneously, a two-embedding RAG architecture. BGE-M3 supports 100+ languages, suggesting multilingual document retrieval. The combination with DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B indicates an active research-grade RAG system.

Documents indexed into the vector store (research papers, agricultural datasets, lab reports, student theses) are queryable via the unauthenticated API.

### F3: CVE-2025-63389 (CRITICAL)

All 5 models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`. The 235B model's context handling is overwritable.
