## Findings

### F1: National Research Centre Node Exposed (MEDIUM)

ITI/CERTH is Greece's premier national research centre (equivalent to Fraunhofer in Germany). The `vcl.iti.gr` hostname confirms this is shared lab infrastructure, not a personal workstation, potential for multiple researcher deployments behind the same exposed port.

### F2: Model Injection (CRITICAL)

CVE-2025-63389 applies.

## Remediation

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```
