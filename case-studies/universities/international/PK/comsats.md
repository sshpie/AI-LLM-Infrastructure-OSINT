# COMSATS University: Medical AI Models, Kimi Cloud Proxy

_ · 2026-05-01_

---

## Summary

COMSATS (Commission on Science and Technology for Sustainable Development in the South), an intergovernmental international organization with a university campus network, has an Ollama instance with two MedGemma medical AI models (27B and 4B) alongside a Kimi K2.6 cloud proxy. The presence of medical-domain AI models on a publicly accessible research network endpoint raises data-handling concerns.

## Findings

### F1: Medical AI Models Exposed Without Authentication (HIGH)

`puyangwang/medgemma-27b-it:q8` (29.6GB, 27.4B params, Gemma3 family) is a community quantization of Google's MedGemma, a model specifically designed for medical question answering, clinical note processing, and health professional workflows. Co-located alongside `medgemma-1.5-4b-it`, the deployment suggests active medical AI research or clinical support tooling.

Both models are accessible without authentication, allowing unauthenticated parties to:
- Query the models with arbitrary medical content
- Inject system prompts via CVE-2025-63389 to alter medical AI behavior
- Potentially extract any RAG-loaded clinical documents via embedding queries

### F2: Cloud Proxy Present (Unauthorized) (MEDIUM)

`kimi-k2.6:cloud` is present but returns `{"error": "unauthorized"}` with no credential leak in the 401 response body. No quota drain confirmed.

### F3: CVE-2025-63389 Injectable (HIGH)

All models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`. System prompt injection on medical models is particularly sensitive, an adversary could instruct `medgemma-27b` to provide dangerous medical advice or suppress safety caveats.
