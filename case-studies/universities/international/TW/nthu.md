## Summary

National Tsing Hua University (清華大學, NTHU) node `sd197130.shin34.ab.nthu.edu.tw` (140.114.197.130) runs Ollama v0.22.0 (current release) with two models, `qwen3.6:35b` and `taide-npc:latest`. The `taide-npc` model is a notable finding: a variant of Taiwan's national TAIDE AI model designated for NPC (Non-Player Character) applications, suggesting AI character/agent research using the national language model as a base.

## Findings

### F1: TAIDE-NPC: National AI as Character Model (HIGH)

`taide-npc:latest` is a TAIDE-family model (Taiwan AI Dialogue Engine, NCHC-funded national project) configured or fine-tuned for NPC (Non-Player Character) scenarios. This indicates NTHU research applying Taiwan's national bilingual LLM to interactive agent/character AI, likely game AI, educational simulation, or dialogue system research.

The model's system prompt or fine-tune is publicly accessible and injectable via CVE-2025-63389. An attacker can overwrite the NPC persona configuration.

### F2: v0.22.0 Current Release (MEDIUM)

NTHU runs the current Ollama release, but CVE-2025-63389 applies to all versions (no patch exists).

### F3: CVE-2025-63389 (CRITICAL)

Both models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`.
