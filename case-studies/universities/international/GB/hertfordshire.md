## Findings

### F1: Free-Tier Cloud Proxy 200 OK (CRITICAL)

`gpt-oss:latest` returns full inference without authentication. 103 tokens total consumed (69 prompt + 34 output) during research confirmation:

```bash
curl -X POST http://147.197.191.230:11434/api/chat \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-oss:latest","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"say hi"}],"stream":false}'
# 200 OK - "Hi! 👋" - operator quota consumed
```

### F2: Research Lab Dev Server (HIGH)

The `robothouse-dev.herts.ac.uk` hostname indicates this is a development/staging server in the RobotHouse robotics research facility. LLM API abuse or injection could affect robot-planning pipelines or research workflows connected to this Ollama instance.

### F3: Model Injection (HIGH)

Both models injectable via CVE-2025-63389.
