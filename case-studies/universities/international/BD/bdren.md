_ · 2026-05-02_

---

## Summary

The Bangladesh Research and Education Network (BdREN), the national research and education network of Bangladesh, exposes one Ollama node on 203.96.189.126. Seven models including Mistral, Llama 3.x, and Gemma2 are accessible without authentication. BdREN is the connectivity backbone for Bangladeshi universities and research institutions. This node sits on the national education backbone.

## Findings

### F1: National Education Backbone Node Exposed (HIGH)

BdREN is Bangladesh's equivalent of Internet2 (US) or JANET (UK), the research and education network connecting all major Bangladeshi universities. An Ollama node on this infrastructure exposes compute at the national backbone level, unauthenticated.

### F2: Free Inference on National Infrastructure (MEDIUM)

Seven general-purpose models accessible without authentication. No cloud proxy, no account takeover surface, but the infrastructure context makes this higher-impact than a typical workstation exposure.

### F3: Model Injection (CRITICAL)

CVE-2025-63389 applies.

## Remediation

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
