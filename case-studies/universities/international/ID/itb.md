## Summary

Institut Teknologi Bandung's LSKK (Laboratorium Sistem Komputer dan Kecerdasan Buatan, Computer Systems and AI Lab, Electrical Engineering) exposes Ollama at `lskk-20.ee.itb.ac.id` (167.205.66.20) with 22 models. The stack includes 7 custom Indonesian-education fine-tuned models and 2 UAT (User Acceptance Testing) performance models, indicating active AI research development for Indonesian educational applications. BGE-M3 embedding signals an active RAG pipeline.

## Findings

### F1: Custom Indonesian Education AI Models Exposed (HIGH)

Seven custom models in the Indonesian education domain:
- `indoedu-e5-base`: a multilingual E5-based embedding model specialized for Indonesian educational content
- `llama-3.1-8b-instruct-indoedu`: Llama 3.1 8B instruction-tuned on Indonesian educational data
- `gemma-3-12b-it-indoedu`: Gemma 3 12B fine-tuned for Indonesian education
- `hf.co/ewideplus/indoedu-e5-base-gguf`: HuggingFace-hosted variant of the same embedding

These represent active research artifacts. All are publicly accessible and injectable via CVE-2025-63389, allowing prompt injection into educational AI systems under development.

### F2: UAT Models: Testing Infrastructure Exposed (HIGH)

`uat-performance-base` and `uat-performance` (both available in q8_0, q4_k_m, and latest quantizations) are labeled "UAT", User Acceptance Testing. Pre-release models under active quality testing are exposed to public inference and injection. Comparison of quantization quality across multiple variants from the test set is accessible to any attacker.

### F3: RAG Pipeline (HIGH)

`bge-m3:latest` + `qwen3:14b` (or `qwen3.6:35b`) signals an active Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline. With the Indonesian education context, this likely processes educational documents. Injecting the retrieval model's system prompt via CVE-2025-63389 poisons all subsequent RAG queries.

### F4: v0.9.2 Ancient Build (HIGH)

Ollama v0.9.2, significantly outdated. No API authentication (which wasn't introduced until later versions), no rate limiting. One of the oldest surviving Ollama deployments in the sweep.

### F5: CVE-2025-63389 (CRITICAL)

All 22 models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`. Impact: custom Indonesian education research models can be poisoned.

## ITB Context

ITB (Institut Teknologi Bandung) is Indonesia's premier technical university, the MIT equivalent of the Indonesian higher education system. The LSKK AI Lab is one of the oldest and most cited AI research groups in Southeast Asia. The `indoedu` fine-tune series suggests ongoing work on AI for Indonesian national education, possibly related to the Ministry of Education's AI curriculum initiatives.
