## Findings

### F1: Government Health Ministry Inference Exposed (HIGH)

All 5 models are accessible without authentication on a Thai government Ministry of Public Health IP. Any internet actor can:
- Run inference against `qwen3.6:35b` (22GB, large model) at MoPH compute cost
- Submit images to `granite3.2-vision:2b` for analysis
- Enumerate all configured models via `/api/tags`

The `granite3.2-vision:2b` model carries IBM's default system prompt (not customized), indicating likely development/testing rather than a custom healthcare application.

No Open WebUI was detected on port 3000. The Ollama API is directly exposed with no frontend authentication layer.

### F2: CVE-2025-63389 Injectable (HIGH)

All 5 models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`. If any of these models are being used for internal MoPH workflows, injected prompts affect those users.
