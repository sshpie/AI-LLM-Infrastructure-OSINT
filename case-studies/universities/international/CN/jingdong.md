# "No. 18 Institute of Jingdong HQ": 26-Node Cluster, China Unicom

_ · 2026-05-02_

---

## Summary

A 26-node Ollama cluster on China Unicom's 111.228.0.0/16 range, all registered to org `eleven street,No. 18 Institute of Jingdong headquarters`. The org name reads as a Chinese physical address (Jingdong district, No. 18 compound), suggesting a large research institute or corporate campus. All nodes run Ollama v0.5.10, a 2023-era version, indicating a static, long-running deployment. Primary models across the cluster: deepseek-r1:1.5b (17 nodes), llama3.2:3b (15 nodes), nomic-embed-text (11 nodes, RAG pipeline). The uniform version and model distribution suggests centralized administration with individual researcher nodes.

## Findings

### F1: 26-Node Cluster, All Public on 0.0.0.0:11434 (CRITICAL)

All 26 nodes expose Ollama on the public internet without authentication. The cluster spans a /16 subnet, suggesting a large campus or research compound with many individual researcher workstations or assigned VMs.

### F2: Stale Version Across Entire Cluster (HIGH)

Every node runs v0.5.10, a November 2023 release. No node has been updated in over 18 months. The uniform version across 26 nodes indicates either: centralized deployment that was never patched, or a managed image used for researcher VMs. All known Ollama CVEs (CVE-2025-63389, SSRF via /api/pull) apply.

### F3: RAG Pipeline Signal (11 nomic-embed-text nodes) (MEDIUM)

11 nodes have `nomic-embed-text:latest` alongside generative models, standard RAG pipeline configuration. Whatever these nodes are processing, vector embeddings are being generated locally.

### F4: Model Injection on All Nodes (CRITICAL)

CVE-2025-63389 applies. Single `/api/create` call injects a persistent system prompt across any of the 26 nodes.
