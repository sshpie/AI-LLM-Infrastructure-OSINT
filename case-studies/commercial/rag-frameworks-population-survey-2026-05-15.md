## Premise & platforms in scope

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework servers sit between vector databases and LLM clients, orchestrating the document-ingestion → chunking → embedding → retrieval → context-injection pipeline. The vector DB layer (Qdrant/Chroma/Milvus) has been surveyed; this is the framework layer above it.

| Platform | Default port | Authoritative auth tier | Identity marker |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LlamaIndex** servers | 8000 | A (no auth concept) | `info.title: "LlamaIndex Chat"` in `/openapi.json` |
| **Haystack** (hayhooks) | 1416 | A* (auth-optional) | `/initialized` JSON + `haystack`/`document_store` in `/openapi.json` |
| **LightRAG** | 9621 | A (no auth concept) | `/api/v1/graph/label/list` returns list, `/docs` contains `LightRAG` |
| **AnythingLLM** | 3001 | A* (auth-optional, signup-open default) | `/api/ping` → `{"online":true}` (or older: `pong`) |
| **RAGFlow** | 9380 | C (auth-on-default) | HTML title `RAGFlow`, `/v1/llm/list` JSON `code` field |
| **PrivateGPT** | 8001 | A (no auth concept) | `/openapi.json` contains `PrivateGPT` AND NOT `document_store` |

---

## Methodology

### Discovery: Shodan brand-dork (Stage 0)

38 priority queries built per platform with the conjunctive marker-anchored rule (Insight #6): each query combines a platform-unique title, body string, or response pattern. Counts taken first (`shodan host count`, 1 query credit each) to size the harvest before fan-out.

**Hit-volume per platform:**

| Platform | Best brand-dork | Hits |
|---|---|---|
| RAGFlow | `http.title:"RAGFlow"` | 1,883 |
| AnythingLLM | `http.title:"AnythingLLM"` | 1,004 |
| LightRAG | `http.title:"LightRAG"` | 88 |
| PrivateGPT | `http.title:"PrivateGPT"` | 6 |
| LlamaIndex | `http.title:"LlamaIndex Chat"` | 1 |
| **Haystack** | 6 queries (`hayhooks`, `port:1416`, `deepset-ai/haystack`, etc.) | **0 — all** |

**Two platforms confirmed Shodan-dark. Insight #21 applies:**

- **Haystack:** all 6 queries returned 0. Port-1416 alone has 672 worldwide listeners but none match `hayhooks` or `uvicorn` strings. Per Insight #21, port-first masscan against tier-2 ranges is the only path.
- **LlamaIndex Chat:** 1-2 hits across all queries. The `create-llama` generated HTML's `<title>` tag is the only brand marker, and it isn't always indexed. Population requires port-first.

The two Shodan-dark platforms validate Insight #21 *empirically*, in a single survey, on two platforms simultaneously.

### Harvest

`shodan download --limit N` (paginating beyond JAXEN's 50/query cap) into per-query `.json.gz` files. Total spend: ~50 query credits for the productive queries. Deduped to **3,773 unique IP:port candidates** across the four productive platforms.

### Probe iterations (three rounds: each caught a FP class)

| Round | Probe | Yield | Bug found |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Existing `rag-framework-probe.py` (HTTP-only) | 538 confirmed (RAGFlow 504, LightRAG 32, PrivateGPT 1, LlamaIndex 1; **AnythingLLM 0/1505**) | HTTP-only; can't probe 443 SNI vhosts |
| 2 | New `probe-https.py` (HTTPS-aware, both schemes) | 545 (AnythingLLM **still 0**) | `/api/ping` checked for `pong` (old release) but newer AnythingLLM returns `{"online":true}` |
| 3 | `probe-https.py` with corrected `/api/ping` marker | 1,787 confirmed | **HTTP status ≠ auth state** (Insight #16) — `auth_required=False` was based on 200 status, but AnythingLLM `/api/system/check-token` returns `200 + body "No auth token found"` and RAGFlow returns `200 + body "code:401"` |
| 4 (re-classify) | `reprobe-anyllm-strict.py` + `reprobe-ragflow.py` — parse JSON body fields directly | **CORRECT counts** | logic refined: AnythingLLM auth from `/api/setup-complete` `results.RequiresAuth`; RAGFlow auth from `/v1/llm/list` JSON `code` field |

Final auth-state classification uses **only primary-source body fields**, never HTTP status alone. This is the Insight #16 discipline operationalized.

---

## Per-platform findings

### AnythingLLM: 483 unauth / 1,242 confirmed (39%)

**Probe:** `GET /api/ping` returns `{"online":true}` or `pong`. Cross-check `GET /api/setup-complete` `results.RequiresAuth` field.

**Auth-state distribution (primary-source `/api/setup-complete`):**
- 483 (38.9%) UNAUTH-ANONYMOUS (`RequiresAuth: false`). Anyone visiting can register / become admin / use the LLM and corpora
- 732 (58.9%) auth-required (`RequiresAuth: true`). Properly locked down
- 20 non-JSON responses (probe degradation, likely proxy-fronted)
- 7 unreachable

**Within the 483 unauth subset. Enriched per-host metadata:**

| EmbeddingEngine | Hosts | LLM-quota-drain risk class |
|---|---|---|
| `native` (bundled MintplexLabs) | 307 | low — local embedder, no operator API cost |
| `ollama` (local Ollama) | 82 | low — local |
| `openai` | 43 | **HIGH — operator's OpenAI key is wired** |
| `generic-openai` (custom endpoint) | 16 | HIGH — operator's custom LLM-provider key |
| `gemini` | 10 | HIGH |
| `unknown`/missing | 10 | unknown |
| `openrouter`, `azure`, `mistral`, `cohere`, `litellm`, `lmstudio`, `localai` | 14 combined | mixed |

**302 of 483 (63%) have `HasExistingEmbeddings: true`**, the operator has already ingested documents into the workspace and persisted embeddings. The corpus exists and is queryable via the chat UI on an unauthenticated session.

**Geographic distribution (unauth subset):**

| Country | Count | Country | Count |
|---|---|---|---|
| United States | 134 | India | 12 |
| China | 84 | Canada | 10 |
| Germany | 71 | Hong Kong | 10 |
| France | 23 | Netherlands | 9 |
| Singapore | 21 | UAE | 9 |
| Japan | 13 | Brazil | 8 |

**Top hosting orgs (unauth subset):**

Hetzner 39 · AWS 64 (Amazon Technologies 34 + Amazon.com 30) · DigitalOcean 30 · Aliyun 29 · Contabo 19 · OVH 14 · Google 13 · Oracle 12 · Tencent 8.

No single dominant operator on the unauth subset. This is a platform-default-misconfiguration class, not a single-operator misdeploy.

### RAGFlow: 0 unauth / 485 confirmed (0%). Auth-on-default thesis confirmed by contrapositive

**Probe:** HTML title `RAGFlow` plus `/v1/dataset/list` reachability. Auth-state re-classification: `GET /v1/llm/list` and parse JSON `code` field. `code:401` = auth-required, `code:0` = unauth-with-data, `code:100` = method/not-found.

**Auth-state distribution (re-verified):**
- 462 (95.3%) auth-required (`code: 401`). Proper login gate
- 17 other-code-None. Non-standard responses, likely proxy-fronted variants
- 6 non-JSON responses
- **0 confirmed unauthenticated**

This is a **negative result that confirms the thesis by its contrapositive**: RAGFlow is Tier-C (auth-on-default), and the population follows the default at 100%. This parallels the prior 2026-05 findings on Langfuse and Phoenix (both Tier-C with 0% unauth in their respective surveys).

**Heavy Chinese deployment:** 343 of 485 (71%) China-hosted. Aliyun 100, Tencent 33+22, Huawei 32, China Mobile 23, Volcano Engine 19. RAGFlow's developer InfiniFlow is China-based; the population follows the brand-origin.

### LightRAG: 55 unauth / 55 confirmed (100%)

**Probe:** `/api/v1/graph/label/list` returns a JSON list, OR `/docs` swagger contains `LightRAG`.

LightRAG has no authentication concept in its default deploy. Every confirmed instance is, by construction, unauthenticated. The 100% rate is the expected Tier-A result.

**Geographic spread:** Germany 13, China 11, US 5, Russia 5, France 4, Netherlands 3, Finland 3. Diverse. No operator cluster.

**Port distribution:** 80 (14), 443 (13), 8000 (6), 8080 (2), 9621 (2, the documented default). Operators routinely run LightRAG behind reverse proxies; default-port-9621 is the *minority* deployment pattern. 42 HTTP / 13 HTTPS.

### PrivateGPT: 4 confirmed, auth state not re-verified

Small population. Confirmed via `/openapi.json` containing `PrivateGPT` and NOT `document_store` (to discriminate from Haystack). Re-verification deferred. Sample size is too small to be population-meaningful.

### LlamaIndex: 1 confirmed (via Shodan), Shodan-dark at population scale

Only 1-2 hits across 6 brand-dorks. The confirmed instance is the single-host case study at `23.239.19.219` (Linode, operator `gochatus.org`). See [the dedicated case study](llamaindex-chat-23-239-19-219-2026-05-15.md).

LlamaIndex Chat is **brand-dork-extinct on Shodan**. The `create-llama`-generated HTML title is inline, Vite-bundled, and not consistently indexed. Population study requires masscan-tier-2 + uvicorn-fingerprint + `/openapi.json` post-probe with `info.title:"LlamaIndex Chat"` verification. Exactly the Insight #21 lane.

### Haystack: 0 confirmed via Shodan, complete brand-dork blackout

All 6 Haystack queries returned 0 hits. Even raw `port:1416` (the canonical hayhooks default) has 672 worldwide listeners, but none of them carry the `hayhooks` or `uvicorn` strings that would Shodan-identify them as Haystack.

The 672 port-1416 listeners are most likely **IBM Tivoli Storage Manager** (port 1416 is the IANA-registered TSM port). Haystack/hayhooks operators have either deployed near-zero instances reachable from the internet, deployed entirely behind reverse proxies that strip the brand string, or both.

**Haystack at population scale needs:**
1. masscan tier-2 (Scaleway/OVH/Linode = 3.55M IPs) on port 1416 + 8000
2. Probe `/initialized` for `{"initialized": true/false}` JSON
3. Cross-check `/openapi.json` for `haystack`/`document_store`

Not run in this survey. Flagged as the Haystack-specific follow-up.

---

## Cross-platform queries: universal 0

| Query | Hits |
|---|---|
| `"openapi" "RAG" "document_store"` | 0 |
| `"X-Powered-By: LlamaIndex"` | 0 |
| `"X-Powered-By: Haystack"` | 0 |

No RAG-framework operator sets a brand-tagging response header. Cross-platform "is this thing a RAG server" detection from raw banner alone is not feasible. Every detection is platform-by-platform.

---

## Insight codifications

### Insight #21 re-confirmed on 2 simultaneous platforms (Haystack + LlamaIndex)

The 2026-05-14 AutoGen Studio survey produced Insight #21. *port-first beats brand-dork for low-footprint platforms*. This survey produces **two new confirming cases in one session**:

- Haystack: 6 brand queries → 0 hits each. Confirmed Shodan-dark.
- LlamaIndex Chat: 6 brand queries → 1-2 total hits across all of them. Confirmed Shodan-dark.

Both have well-known default ports (1416 / 8000) and well-known FastAPI surface, but the brand string sits in HTML titles that Shodan doesn't reliably crawl through. Port-first masscan is the only path to population data.

### Insight #16 re-applied: auth state from JSON body, never HTTP status

Both AnythingLLM and RAGFlow returned **HTTP 200 even when auth was required**, with the actual auth-state signal in the response body:

- AnythingLLM `/api/system/check-token` returns `200` with body `{"error":"No auth token found."}` when auth is on but no token presented. Probing on HTTP status alone marks this as "unauth". Wrong.
- RAGFlow `/v1/llm/list`, `/v1/conversation/list`, `/v1/user/info` *all* return `HTTP 200` with body `{"code":401,"data":null,"message":"<Unauthorized '401: Unauthorized'>"}` when auth required. The HTTP-status signal is uniformly wrong; the body's `code` field is the truth.

Two platforms in one survey, both with this exact pattern. The first iteration of this survey published numbers off the HTTP-status signal and was corrected during sample-verification (8/8 AS63949 AnythingLLM sample showed `RequiresAuth: true` despite probe marking them unauth). The corrected probe parses `/api/setup-complete` `results.RequiresAuth` for AnythingLLM and `/v1/llm/list` `code` field for RAGFlow.

### New Insight candidate #23: fingerprint marker drift across platform versions

AnythingLLM `/api/ping` returns:
- **older versions:** plain text `pong`
- **newer versions:** JSON `{"online":true}`

The existing `rag-framework-probe.py` checked for `pong` only and missed the entire current-release population (0 of 1,505 candidates confirmed against the canonical `pong` marker). A platform fingerprint is not static. Markers drift across versions. Probes must check for *every documented historical marker*, and a fingerprint should be flagged for re-validation when a survey's confirmation rate is suspiciously low.

This pairs naturally with Insight #6 (conjunctive markers). The conjunction *is* the catch, but each conjunct's exact string is version-dependent and needs maintenance.

---

## Auth-on-default thesis: single-survey triple confirmation

This is the rare survey where three different platform tiers were measured at population scale in one pass:

```
Tier-A   (no auth concept)        — LightRAG     → 55/55  unauth (100%)  ✓ confirmed
Tier-A*  (auth-optional, default-open) — AnythingLLM → 483/1242 unauth (39%) ✓ confirmed
Tier-C   (auth-on-default)        — RAGFlow      → 0/485   unauth (0%)   ✓ confirmed (contrapositive)
```

The thesis predicts each. The data delivers each. The pattern is not platform-specific. It tracks the shipping default, not the operator's skill.

This is also the first survey to put a number on Tier-A* "auth-optional with signup-open" at population scale. The prediction was *somewhere between 0% and 100% depending on how aggressive the platform's first-run wizard is*. AnythingLLM lands at 39%. Almost exactly midway, consistent with a tutorial-default where the wizard nudges but doesn't enforce.

---

## Operator-side risk surface: within the 483 AnythingLLM unauth

For the 483 confirmed unauth AnythingLLM instances, the operator-side risk surface decomposes into three classes:

1. **Corpus exposure (302 hosts):** Operator has ingested documents. Anyone visiting the web UI can register, become admin, and read the entire vector store contents via the chat UI. Document classes will vary widely. Personal notes, internal-business docs, course materials, legal/medical/financial corpora.
2. **LLM-quota-drain / LLMjacking (80+ hosts):** Operator wired a paid-tier LLM key (OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, Azure, Mistral, Cohere, LiteLLM, etc.) into the workspace. Anonymous users can drive completions against that key. Direct billing impact.
3. **Local-LLM compute theft (389 hosts on native+ollama):** Less monetary cost to the operator but free inference for whoever finds the host.

Restraint ethic: no extraction was performed. The 302/80/389 counts are derived from the `/api/setup-complete` metadata only (`HasExistingEmbeddings`, `EmbeddingEngine`), not from reading any corpus content. The metadata IS the finding (Insight #2, collection/experiment/project names ARE the finding).
