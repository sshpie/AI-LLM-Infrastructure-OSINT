## Purpose

This ledger tracks coordinated-disclosure status for the operators identified in the Qdrant tier-2 + Backup-Snapshot surveys. **Operator identities are redacted** until either (a) the 30-day disclosure window elapses without remediation, or (b) the operator confirms remediation and consents to public attribution.

## DCWF KSAT coverage

Auto-derived from DCWF AI work-role rule files (`ksat-tag`).

- **672 (AI Test & Evaluation Specialist):** K7003, K7004, K7054, S7068, S7070, S7075, T5904, T5919
- **733 (AI Risk & Ethics Specialist):** K7040, T5854, T5868, T5882
- **overlap (Common AI KSATs (all 5 roles)):** K1157, K1158, K22, K6311, K6900, K6935, K7003, K942

<!-- ksat-tag:auto-generated:end -->

The redaction is the same coordinated-disclosure courtesy  extends in every disclosure: name the IP and the role/sector, never the operator, until the window is complete.

### Unidentified operators (no TLS on :443, OVH default rDNS only)

These hosts are part of the same survey but cannot be operator-attributed without further pivots. Listed for completeness:

| IP | Snapshot exposure observed |
|---|---|
| 137.74.118.71 | `thirard_expert` collections (~1.8 MB snapshots), Thirard appears to be a French locksmith brand; operator unconfirmed |
| 141.95.107.232 | `pim-hybrid` (199 MB snap), Product Information Management RAG |
| 151.80.234.120 | (no snapshot exposure observed) |
| 167.114.115.192 | `hce_chunks`, `epc_feedback` (small daily snaps) |
| 172.104.46.174 | (no snapshot exposure observed) |
| 51.75.26.136 | (no snapshot exposure observed) |

## Disclosure procedure

For each identified operator above:

1. **Email draft prepared** at `~/recon/<operator-slug>-disclosure-2026-05-04/` (private, off-repo)
2. **30-day coordinated-disclosure window** opens at the date the email is sent
3. **Re-probe schedule** during the window:
   - First 24h: every 6h (verify operator received + initial response)
   - 24h – 72h: every 12h
   - 72h – 7d: daily
   - 7d – 30d: weekly
4. **Re-probe leading indicators** for each host:
   ```bash
   curl http://<ip>:6333/collections
   # → 401 Unauthorized = remediated (api_key set)
   # → 200 OK with collections list = unfixed, attack continuing
   # → connection refused = bound to localhost or firewalled (also remediated)
   ```
5. **At day 30** if unremediated: lift the operator-identity redaction in the public case study; update this ledger with the operator's name and full technical detail.
6. **At remediation confirmation**: update this ledger ("Remediated: <date>"); do NOT lift redaction without operator's explicit consent. Some operators prefer to remain redacted even after fixing.

## Aggregate metrics (informational)

- **663 unauth Qdrant instances** identified across the tier-2 cloud survey
- **16 of 663** have pre-built snapshot files = direct bulk-exfiltration vectors
- **All 663** are vulnerable to remote-snapshot-creation-and-download via `POST /snapshots` ( did not exercise this, but the surface exists)
- **22 disclosure-priority operators identified** via TLS cert pivots, disclosure drafts staged for all
- **Highest-impact targets surfaced beyond the snapshot subset:** government-class international organization (OIF/Francophonie, 1.1M points, 88-member-state observatory), Polish accounting firm (692K client chat-messages), French notary platform (JudiLibre custom RAG), Brazilian education tech (1.35M points), subscription financial-regulation analytics SaaS (subscriber-content business-model leak)
