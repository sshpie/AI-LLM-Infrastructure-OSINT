# Ollama on Tier-2 Cloud: Auth Posture Survey (Scope Expansion)

_ · 2026-05-04 (corrected after honeypot-fleet discovery)_
_Companion to: [`ollama-cloud-survey-2026-05.md`](ollama-cloud-survey-2026-05.md) (DO/Hetzner/Vultr baseline)_

> **2026-05-04 correction note:** Initial publication of this case study reported 1,019 unauth Ollama instances on tier-2 clouds, including a "197-host Linode marketplace template cluster" (Ollama 0.1.33 + identical 5-model loadout). Subsequent cross-validation against tier-2 Milvus probe data revealed that **169 of the original 259 Linode hits, including ~188 of the 197 "0.1.33 marketplace" hosts, are part of an AS63949 (Akamai/Linode) JSON-honeypot deception fleet** that returns convincing-but-fake Ollama / Milvus / generic-AI-API responses on every probed port. The fleet's signature is documented in the new "Honeypot pollution and the AS63949 deception fleet" section below. Numbers in this survey have been **corrected to 850 real unauth Ollama instances** (Linode 90, OVH 714, Scaleway 46). The honeypot finding is methodologically significant for the survey series and is folded into the synthesis paper.

## Summary

Mass-scan of port 11434 (Ollama default) across **76 cloud /16 ranges spanning Scaleway, OVH, and Linode**, three tier-2 budget clouds outside the original DO/Hetzner/Vultr baseline. **3.55 million IPs scanned → 7,335 port-open candidates → 1,019 raw fingerprint hits → 850 real unauthenticated Ollama instances after filtering 169 honeypots from the AS63949 deception fleet**.

The expansion confirms the auth-off-default thesis is **operator-culture-independent**:

| Cloud | Audience | /16-class ranges | IPs scanned | Real unauth Ollama | Density (per M IPs) | Honeypot pollution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DO/Hetzner/Vultr (baseline) | US/EU mixed | 28 | 1,830,000 | 342 | 187 | 0 |
| **Scaleway** | French | 7 | 425,984 | 46 | 108 | 0 |
| **OVH** | French/Canadian | 33 | 1,961,984 | 714 | **364** | 0 |
| **Linode (Akamai)** | US-anchored global | 36 | 1,162,240 | **90** | **77** | **169 honeypots filtered** |
| **Tier-2 combined** |, | **76** | **3,550,208** | **850** | **240** | 169 |

OVH alone has roughly the same number of unauth Ollama instances as the entire DO/Hetzner/Vultr baseline times two. The thesis (Ollama framework has no auth concept; operators who put it on the public internet are exposed by default) reproduces cleanly across French, Canadian, and Akamai-anchored populations.

The novel findings extend the original survey:

1. **`:cloud` billing-fraud surface scales linearly.** Across tier-2 clouds, **471 of 1,019 unauth Ollama hosts (46.2%) have at least one `:cloud`-suffix model loaded**, every external prompt against those hosts spends the operator's Ollama Cloud subscription. Top exposures: `minimax-m2.7:cloud` (358 hosts), `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` (289), `kimi-k2.6:cloud` (68), `qwen3-coder-next:cloud` (66). 22 hosts carry `gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud`, Google Gemini routed through Ollama Cloud, billing back to Google's API contract on the operator's account.

2. **Linode hosts a 393-host AS63949 honeypot fleet, ~188 of which spoof as Ollama 0.1.33.** Initially mis-attributed as a "frozen marketplace template cluster," cross-validation against the Milvus probe revealed these are deception infrastructure, not real customer deployments. Signature: kitchen-sink JSON returned on every probed port (11434/19530/6333/22/80/443/etc.) containing fake JWTs, `admin@example.com`, shadow-style `wW0sffoqsk.EM` salt, dizquetv RCE PoC strings, and a forged `/api/tags` response with the canonical 5-model "0.1.33 marketplace" loadout (`deepseek-r1:latest`, `llama3:8b-text-q4_K_S`, `qwen:latest`, `llama3:latest`, `mistral:latest`). See the dedicated section below.

3. **Abliterated/uncensored finetune ecosystem visible at population scale.** 20 unique safety-rail-removed finetunes across the tier-2 surface, including:
   - `huihui_ai/qwen3.5-abliterated:122B` (122B-param abliterated Qwen)
   - `charaf/gemma4-31b-claude-opus-abliterated:latest`
   - `zfujicute/OmniCoder-Qwen3.5-9B-Claude-4.6-Opus-Uncensored-v2-GGUF:latest`
   - `vaultbox/qwen3.5-uncensored:35b`
   - `frob/mradermacher-Llama3.3-8B-Thinking-Heretic-Claude-4.5-Opus:q8_0`

   These are operators who have *specifically* selected uncensored variants and made them anonymously queryable. The exposure isn't accidental in the same way an admin panel is, these operators want the model running unrestricted, they just left it open to the internet too.

## Methodology

```
masscan -iL <76 tier-2 cloud /16 CIDRs> -p 11434 --rate 10000

Scaleway  → 7 prefixes,  425,984 IPs → 111 port-open
OVH       → 33 prefixes, 1,961,984 IPs → 5,341 port-open
Linode    → 36 prefixes, 1,162,240 IPs → 1,883 port-open
TOTAL     → 76 prefixes, 3,550,208 IPs → 7,335 port-open

ollama-probe.py (200-thread fingerprint)
  GET /            → text "Ollama is running" (canonical signature)
  GET /api/version → version JSON
  GET /api/tags    → loaded model list with size, quantization, family
  → 1,019 confirmed Ollama instances
```

Same probe script as the DO/Hetzner/Vultr baseline. Read-only metadata enumeration only, no `/api/generate`, no `/api/chat`, no `/api/embeddings`. Submitting an inference request would have spent the operator's compute (and for `:cloud` models, the operator's Ollama Cloud quota).

Confirm rate (Ollama / port-open):
- Scaleway: 41.4% (46/111), high, suggests cleaner port allocation discipline
- OVH: 13.4% (714/5,341), many port-11434 hits are non-Ollama (filtered, honeypot, other service)
- Linode: 13.8% (259/1,883)

## Top Exposed `:cloud` Models (Operator Billing-Fraud Surface)

Every external prompt against these endpoints spends the operator's Ollama Cloud quota:

| Model | Tier-2 hosts exposed | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `minimax-m2.7:cloud` | **358** | MiniMax M2.7, Chinese long-context reasoning model |
| `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` | **289** | DeepSeek V4 Pro, top-of-stack DeepSeek inference |
| `kimi-k2.6:cloud` | 68 | Moonshot Kimi K2.6 |
| `qwen3-coder-next:cloud` | 66 | Alibaba Qwen3-Coder (next-gen) |
| `glm-5.1:cloud` | 33 | Zhipu GLM-5.1 |
| `deepseek-v3.2:cloud` | 29 | DeepSeek V3.2 |
| `kimi-k2.5:cloud` | 24 | Moonshot Kimi K2.5 |
| `deepseek-v4-flash:cloud` | 22 | DeepSeek V4 Flash |
| **`gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud`** | **22** | **Google Gemini 3 Flash via Ollama Cloud, bills the operator's GCP/Google API contract** |
| `glm-5:cloud` | 22 | Zhipu GLM-5 |
| `minimax-m2.5:cloud` | 21 | MiniMax M2.5 |
| `glm-4.6:cloud` | 20 | Zhipu GLM-4.6 |
| `glm-4.7:cloud` | 20 | Zhipu GLM-4.7 |
| `kimi-k2-thinking:cloud` | 20 | Moonshot Kimi K2 Thinking |
| `minimax-m2.1:cloud` | 20 | MiniMax M2.1 |

**Aggregate**: 1,034 distinct `:cloud`-host-model bindings across 471 hosts. The most-exposed pair (MiniMax M2.7) means an attacker with a 30-second curl loop can drain the quota of any of 358 unauthenticated operators.

## Honeypot pollution and the AS63949 deception fleet

Cross-validation against the parallel tier-2 Milvus probe revealed that 169 of the original 259 Linode "unauth Ollama" hits are not real Ollama deployments, they are part of a **393-host honeypot fleet on AS63949 (Akamai Connected Cloud / Linode)** designed to catch automated AI-stack vulnerability scanners.

**Discovery path.** A separate masscan/probe pass on port 19530 (Milvus) returned 429 "confirmed Milvus" responses on the same tier-2 ranges. 393 of those 429 returned a kitchen-sink JSON response that no real Milvus would produce, fields including `accessToken`, `csrfToken`, `admin@example.com`, fake JWT tokens, and a `xmsg` field reading `"Successfully\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\nroot\nLinux sensor 5.15.0-106-generic..."`. Cross-checking the 393 honeypot IPs against the Linode Ollama dataset showed **188 of them** were among the 197 "Ollama 0.1.33 marketplace" hosts. Re-probing those hosts on additional ports (22, 80, 443, 5000, 8080, 8443, 9001, 9090, 9200, 27017, 6379, 5432, 3306, 11211) showed **every single port "open"** with the same kitchen-sink JSON template, no real service does this.

**Honeypot signature.** A salt string `wW0sffoqsk.EM` appears in shadow-style fake passwd entries returned by every fleet member. Other distinctive markers:

- Forged `/api/tags` response that mixes Ollama-shaped chat-completion fields (`role`, `content`, `total_duration`, `eval_count`) with a `models` array of exactly 5 entries (deepseek-r1, llama3:8b-text-q4_K_S, qwen, llama3, mistral), real Ollama's `/api/tags` doesn't include any of the chat-completion fields
- Forged `/v2/vectordb/collections/list` response containing `dizquetv:1.5.3`, `ffmpeg` shadow-passwd strings, fake `accessToken`/`refreshToken`/`csrfToken`, mock `userGUID`, mock `apiUsage` counters, even a forged `proof_file:/tmp/a` "exploitation success" indicator
- Fake SSH banners on port 22 (e.g., `SSH-2.0-MocanassH5.3.1`, `SSH-2.0-paramiko2.12.0`, `SSH-2.0-HUAWEI-1.5`, different banner per host but all distinct from real SSHd)
- Random WordPress plugin readme.txt or generic IT-management-product HTML on port 80 (e.g., "Arigato Autoresponder", "Filr - Secure document library")
- Models in the forged Ollama response stamped with `+08:00` timezone, the operator timezone is GMT+8 (Singapore / China / HK)

**Detector.** The unique salt `wW0sffoqsk.EM` plus the kitchen-sink-JSON pattern (chat-completion-fields-mixed-with-models-array) are sufficient signatures. 's filter pulled 169 honeypot IPs from the Ollama tier-2 dataset (-65% Linode false-positive rate) and 393 from the Milvus tier-2 dataset (-91% false-positive rate). The Qdrant probe was strict enough (required exact `"title":"qdrant - vector search engine"` JSON) that **no honeypots passed it**, Qdrant tier-2 numbers are unaffected.

**Attribution.** All 393 hosts are on AS63949 (Akamai Connected Cloud, formerly Linode). Distributed across at least 8 different Linode /16 ranges (`103.3.x`, `109.74.x`, `139.144.x`, `139.162.x`, `172.234.x`, `66.228.x`, `74.207.x`, etc.). The +08:00 timezone in forged data and the SSH-banner inconsistency (HUAWEI, paramiko, MocanassH all on different hosts) suggest either **Akamai's own threat-intel research infrastructure**, a commercial honeypot-as-a-service operator, or a third-party security-research consortium hosting on Linode. The fleet is professionally maintained, the kitchen-sink template captures every common AI/ML scanner heuristic in a single response, including specific markers for ffmpeg-RCE, dizquetv passthrough, and CVE-2025-style "VULNERABLE -version" triggers.

**Methodological lesson.** Population-scale OSINT scans of cloud-hosted infrastructure must filter known-honeypot fleets. The AS63949 fleet specifically targets AI-infrastructure scanner heuristics, any "high hit rate" of Ollama/Milvus/etc. on Linode is partly noise from this fleet. The auth-on-default thesis is unaffected (the honeypot fleet doesn't change real-deployment counts), but the operator-population estimates do. Going forward, the Ollama survey series adds the AS63949-fleet filter as a standard preprocessing step.

**The remaining 9 "Ollama 0.1.33" hosts on Linode** that didn't trip the honeypot detector may be either (a) real frozen 2024 Ollama deployments that happen to share the marketplace's default-model loadout, or (b) honeypots that returned a different response shape during the cross-check probe. They are tagged but kept in the dataset as ambiguous.

## Abliterated / Uncensored Finetunes (Tier-2 Surface)

These are operator-curated safety-rail-removed models. The operator selected them deliberately. They are also exposed unauth.

| Model | Description |
|---|---|
| `huihui_ai/qwen3.5-abliterated:122B` | 122B-param abliterated Qwen 3.5 |
| `huihui_ai/Qwen3.6-abliterated:35b` | 35B abliterated Qwen 3.6 |
| `huihui_ai/deepseek-r1-abliterated:32b` | Abliterated DeepSeek R1 |
| `huihui_ai/qwen3.5-abliterated:4B` / `:2b` | Smaller abliterated Qwen variants |
| `huihui_ai/qwen2.5-abliterate:0.5b` | 0.5B abliterated Qwen 2.5 |
| `hf.co/huihui-ai/Huihui-granite-4.1-3b-abliterated:BF16` | Abliterated IBM Granite |
| `charaf/gemma4-31b-claude-opus-abliterated:latest` | Abliterated Gemma 4 31B (Claude-Opus distilled) |
| `gemma4-26b-abliterated:latest` | 26B Gemma 4 abliterated |
| `gemma4-uncensored:latest` | Gemma 4 uncensored |
| `gemma4-e4b-heretic:latest` | Gemma 4 e4b "heretic" finetune |
| `juilpark/gemma-4-31B-it-uncensored-heretic:q4_k_m` | Gemma 4 31B uncensored "heretic" |
| `hf.co/Andycurrent/Gemma-3-4B-VL-it-Gemini-Pro-Heretic-Uncensored-Thinking_GGUF:Q4_K_M` | Vision-language Gemma 3 uncensored "heretic" |
| `Hudson/llama3.1-uncensored:8b` | Llama 3.1 uncensored |
| `vaultbox/qwen3.5-uncensored:35b` | 35B uncensored Qwen 3.5 |
| `hf.co/SpaceTimee/Suri-Qwen-3.5-9B-Uncensored-GGUF:Q8_0` | 9B uncensored Qwen 3.5 |
| `hf.co/Ex0bit/Elbaz-Olmo-3-7B-Instruct-abliterated:latest` | Abliterated AI2 OLMo 3 |
| `hf.co/bartowski/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-abliterated-GGUF:Q5_K_M` | Abliterated Qwen 2.5 Coder |
| `frob/mradermacher-Llama3.3-8B-Thinking-Heretic-Claude-4.5-Opus:q8_0` | Llama 3.3 "heretic" Opus-distilled |
| `zfujicute/OmniCoder-Qwen3.5-9B-Claude-4.6-Opus-Uncensored-v2-GGUF:latest` | Uncensored Opus-distilled coding model |

The pattern across the tier-2 surface: **abliterated/uncensored models are concentrated on OVH** (operators who chose OVH for low-cost GPU + low-policy-friction hosting), with a smaller cluster on Linode. Scaleway shows only one example (`rnj-1:8b`), likely because the Scaleway operator population skews toward enterprise/SaaS tenants who use the standard model stack.

---

## Cross-Cloud Comparison (vs. DO/Hetzner/Vultr baseline)

| Metric | DO/Hetzner/Vultr | Scaleway | OVH | Linode (real) | Tier-2 total (real) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| /16 ranges | 28 | 7 | 33 | 36 | 76 |
| IPs scanned | 1.83M | 426K | 1.96M | 1.16M | 3.55M |
| Real unauth Ollama | 342 | 46 | 714 | **90** | **850** |
| Density per M IPs | 187 | 108 | **364** | 77 | 240 |
| `:cloud` exposure rate | 50.3% | 50.0% | **59.4%** | (mostly honeypots; real <10%) | 55.4% |

**Headline numbers across both surveys combined (post-honeypot-filter):**

- **1,192 real unauthenticated Ollama instances** across 5.38M cloud IPs scanned
- **643 instances** loading at least one `:cloud` model (operator-quota-theft surface)
- **42+ unique abliterated/uncensored finetunes** anonymously queryable
- **0 surveys returned an authenticated Ollama instance**, the framework cannot enforce auth, and no operator in the survey deployed a reverse-proxy auth layer
- **393-host AS63949 honeypot fleet identified**, methodological by-product of the cross-validation pass

The auth-on-default thesis (from the cross-survey synthesis paper) holds without exception: Ollama is in the **"auth concept doesn't exist in the framework"** tier, alongside vector DBs, MLflow, and pre-2.x inference servers. Operators who put it on the public internet are exposed.

---

## Auth-On-Default Tier Map (Updated)

| Tier | Auth in framework default | Surveyed deployments | Unauth rate observed |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A, No auth concept** | No | 1,361 Ollama, 151 Qdrant, 32 Milvus, 33 MLflow, 313 Elasticsearch | 100% |
| **B, Auth optional, off by default** | Off | 1,432 ChromaDB, 47 Mem0, 178 Triton, 122 vLLM | 100% |
| **C, Setup wizard / first-run takeover** | First user wins | Dify (5 takeable / 100s deployed) | <5% |
| **D, Auth on by default** | On | 852 MinIO, OpenWebUI, n8n, Flowise | 0% (all bounced) |

The original survey's hypothesis that **"auth-on-default is load-bearing"** holds. The Linode marketplace cluster adds a fifth observation: **template defaults that ship without auth are functionally equivalent to having no auth concept**, regardless of which tier the underlying framework is in. Linode's Ollama template inherits Ollama's "no auth concept" framework, but the failure mode is platform-mediated (197 customers, one template, one default).

---

## Disclosure Posture

The aggregate exposure (1,019 unauth instances, 471 cloud-billing-exposed, 197-host marketplace cluster, 20+ uncensored finetunes) is too large for per-host disclosure. 's posture:

1. **No per-host abuse reports**, the framework has no auth, the operators chose to deploy unauth on the public internet. Per-host disclosure load would scale to thousands of emails with no fix path beyond "add a firewall rule."

2. **Platform-level disclosure to Linode** for the 197-host marketplace cluster, the template default is the systemic issue. Linode can update the marketplace App to ship with `OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1` + a proxy auth layer, and that single change patches all current and future deployments.

3. **Ollama upstream awareness**, the `:cloud` model billing-fraud surface is a framework-level design issue. Loading a `:cloud` model on an unauth Ollama instance creates a quota-theft endpoint; the framework should require local auth before allowing `:cloud` model registration. Disclosure draft pending.

4. **Aggregate publication**, this case study is the public-facing record. Operators who find their IP listed in the supplementary data can apply the fix (firewall rule, reverse proxy with auth, or `OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1`).
