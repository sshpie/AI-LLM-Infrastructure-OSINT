## Summary

We sampled 150 of the 3,604 fully-wiped Elasticsearch hosts from this morning's re-probe. We read the `read_me` index on each one. Three different actors are running the campaign in parallel.

Three wallets. Three contact addresses. Three different note schemas (the mapping shapes differ across hosts, which means three different tools). Only Actor A is monetizing.

## The ransom note (Actor A)

```
Your database has been deleted from your server, but all the information
remains stored on our cluster. The instructions for recovery are as follows:
You must send 0.0041 BTC to the following wallet:
bc1q38rjul6gdamfflf6p4ukz0ymtvfgfv2j9saf6r .
Then, you must send an email to wendy.etabw@gmx.com with the following code:
0SH7HH1Q72JL (it is important that you write it correctly, as it corresponds
to your database).
You must also attach the txid (the Bitcoin transaction ID) to the message.
After following these steps, we will send you a zip file with all your
information.
You have 48 hours to complete the steps.
For More Info - https://tli.sh/73x1k
```

The code `0SH7HH1Q72JL` is identical across hundreds of hosts. The "corresponds to your database" line is a template lie. The "all the information remains stored on our cluster" line is also a lie. The Meow / Indexrm family deletes data and stores nothing. Payment recovers nothing.

The `tli.sh` URL redirects to a `paste.sh` page with client-side encryption. We decrypted it with the key in the URL fragment.

```

Once you pay, you'll get a download link which you can use to download all
your data back.

The China-specific guidance matches the victim population. Most wiped hosts in our 150-host sample are on Tencent, Aliyun, and Huawei Cloud.

## Per-actor profile

### Actor A

Wallet `bc1q38rjul6gdamfflf6p4ukz0ymtvfgfv2j9saf6r`. Five paid victims. About 0.018 BTC received and swept out.

Email `wendy.etabw@gmx.com`. GMX free German webmail.

Note schema is a single `message` field carrying the prose above. Demand 0.0041 BTC, roughly $400.

### Actor B

Wallet `bc1quwlw8djc7hfamf3qpspma34uh9dr6w4kudfu8p`. Zero paid victims. Zero income.

Email `db-recovery@sharebot.net`. The domain is less common.

Note schema is five fields: `amount`, `bitcoin`, `email`, `message`, `warning`. The structured schema lets an automated decoder parse fields without regex. That choice suggests slightly more deliberate tooling.

### Actor C

Wallet `bc1qvrryy2vsq4jekejs8z2elkt3sxmhlyad06ymvr`. Zero paid victims. Zero income.

Email `scandal@onionmail.org`. Tor-routed mail. Defensible against subpoena.

Note schema is three fields: `message`, `timestamp`, `warning`. Demand 0.0035 BTC, slightly lower than Actor A.

Anomalous: this actor plants 112 documents in the `read_me` index. Other actors plant one. The hospital host on UCloud (`106.75.127.240`) is one of this actor's targets.

---

## Restraint

We read the `read_me` mapping and one document per host. That is attacker-broadcast content. The actor wrote it for victims to read.

We did not read any other index on any of the 150 hosts. No operator data, no patient records, no PII. Only the attacker's own message.

---

## Implication for disclosure framing

A bulk-disclosure batch from yesterday's wiped-host list needs per-host actor classification before send. A template that names Actor A works for 91% of hosts and is wrong for 9%. Each disclosure draft should re-probe the target host and extract the wallet and email before composing the body.

aimap v1.9.9 (shipped this morning) adds the `compromised_by_extortion` classifier. A v1.9.10 follow-up will extract the actor identifier and tag the host. Then disclosure templates can be per-actor-aware.

## Toolchain provenance

```
fast-probe    [x] 150-host concurrent probe (40 workers, 6s timeout)
                 read_me _mapping (metadata) and read_me _search size=1
                 (attacker-broadcast). No probing of operator data indices.
mempool.space [x] wallet investigation on all 3 attacker wallets.
                 A: 5 paid, 0.018 BTC swept.
                 B: 0 paid, 0 BTC.
                 C: 0 paid, 0 BTC.
paste.sh      [x] decrypted the Actor A follow-up page client-side
                 (AES-256-CBC, PBKDF2 SHA512 iter=1, key in URL fragment).
aimap v1.9.9  [—] not used for this probe. v1.9.10 will fold the
                 multi-actor extraction into enumElasticsearch.
visorlog      [x] earlier ingest stands.
```
