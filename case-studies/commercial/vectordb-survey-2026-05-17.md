# Vector database population survey, 2026-05-17

_, 2026-05-17 (overnight pass)_
_Survey #22 in the AI infrastructure series._

---

## Summary

We surveyed the public vector-database population: Qdrant, Weaviate, Milvus, ChromaDB. Vector DBs hold the embeddings for an operator's RAG pipeline. Every document, customer transcript, support ticket, legal record, or PII row the operator has chunked and indexed for retrieval. The Meow / Indexrm extortion campaign hits Elasticsearch only, so unlike yesterday's ES population the vector-DB population is *not* wipe-contaminated. Operator data is alive.

<!-- ksat-tag:auto-generated:end -->

From 917 candidate IPs harvested via protocol-strict Shodan dorks, aimap confirmed:

| Service | Unique IPs (unauth) |
|---|---:|
| Weaviate | 127 |
| Milvus | 59 |
| ChromaDB | 39 |
| Qdrant | 38 |

The Qdrant cohort is the most readable (the API exposes collection names + point counts at `/collections`). The Weaviate cohort is the most metadata-rich (the schema includes self-declared `pii_fields` markers). What follows is the headline-impact subset, schema-only enumeration, no document reads performed.

## advocat-online.ru: 214 million vector points

The single host at `89.108.123.166` (Reg.Ru hosting in Russia, TLS SAN `advocat-online.ru`) is the largest exposed vector store we have ever surveyed. The 18 collections describe a full Russian legal AI knowledge base:

| Collection | Points |
|---|---:|
| `regional_zakon` (regional law) | 104,297,989 |
| `law` | 32,446,259 |
| `law_zakonod_1_hybrid` | 24,508,936 |
| `arbitrazh_sud` (arbitration court) | 9,975,000 |
| `law_zakonod_2_hybrid` | 8,577,657 |
| `soi` (likely Сведения о Юридических Лицах — Legal Entity Records) | 8,454,000 |
| `comment_law` | 6,498,713 |
| `law_no_zakonod_hybrid` | 5,884,352 |
| `fin_kadr_consult` (financial/HR consulting) | 4,724,509 |
| `vushie_sud` (higher courts) | 4,456,858 |
| `tech_norm_pravila` (technical norms/rules) | 3,010,023 |
| `cons_budget` (budget consultations) | 890,267 |
| `forms_documents` | 570,512 |
| `svo` (empty) | 0 |
| `user` (empty) | 0 |
| `books` (empty) | 0 |

The empty `svo` collection is notable. "SVO" is the Russian-government abbreviation for "Specialnaya Voennaya Operatsia". The official term for the Russia-Ukraine war. An advocate-services platform with a dedicated empty SVO collection suggests anticipated legal-services demand for the conflict (military exemptions, casualty claims, conscription appeals).

Additional ports on the same host: PostgreSQL (5432), POP/IMAP/SMTP mail stack (110/143/465/995/25), Nacos config server (8848). Likely a full LAMP-style deployment with the vector DB sitting alongside the relational and mail layers.

---

## RefugeeContent on Weaviate (`141.94.237.69`)

Weaviate's schema endpoint reports `pii_fields` as a per-property tag. One host carries this:

```json
{
  "name": "RefugeeContent",
  "vectorizer": "none",
  "properties": 24,
  "objects": 1,
  "pii_fields": ["source_username", "geo_address", "geo_phones", "geo_emails"]
}
```

The schema is **self-declared by the operator** to contain refugee identity records with geolocated contact info. The class name `RefugeeContent` plus four PII fields covering geographic address, phone numbers, and email addresses is among the most sensitive PII categories possible. Refugees often face active persecution from state actors or non-state armed groups; geolocation data plus phone/email exposes them to direct contact attack vectors.

The host is on OVH France (`vps-bbd11dc6.vps.ovh.net`). Adjacent open ports include **MongoDB (27017)** and **PostgreSQL (5432)**, both potentially carrying the underlying refugee records (Weaviate stores the embeddings; the source documents are typically in the relational DB).

Disclosure routing: OVH SAS abuse + cert-pivot to identify the operator. This is a humanitarian-emergency-class exposure.

## aishelter.underdog.my.id: Indonesian shelter HRIS

Indonesian host at `103.247.10.156` (Rumahweb Indonesia hosting, TLS SAN `aishelter.underdog.my.id`):

| Collection | Points |
|---|---:|
| `shelter_payroll` | 338,055 |
| `shelter_hris_employee_detail` | 208,053 |
| `shelter_hris_employee_site` | 207,851 |

754,000 employee/payroll records across what appears to be an HR information system for a shelter network. "Shelter" in this naming convention typically refers to humanitarian / NGO / homeless / domestic-violence shelter organizations. Adjacent ports include MySQL (3306), suggesting the relational source data is on the same host.

---

## bolt.kaychalabs.com: Internal enterprise AI knowledge stack

`204.10.144.25` (Revelex hosting, TLS SAN `bolt.kaychalabs.com`, prior cert `kaycha-ai.revelex.com`). 4.2M points across the "jarvis_*" naming pattern indicates a complete enterprise AI assistant:

| Collection | Points |
|---|---:|
| `jarvis_knowledge` | 3,589,311 |
| `jarvis_documents` | 463,716 |
| `jarvis_code` | 166,829 |
| `jarvis_tech_docs` | 11,082 |
| `jarvis_legal` | 8,714 |
| `jarvis_communications` | 6,170 |
| `jarvis_memory` | 2,522 |
| `jarvis_financial` | 1,164 |
| `jarvis_regulations` | 362 |
| `jarvis_schemas` | 63 |

`jarvis_legal`, `jarvis_financial`, `jarvis_communications` together imply the operator has embedded their internal legal, financial, and communications archives for AI retrieval. PostgreSQL (5432) is also open on this host.

Revelex is a travel-industry technology firm. Kaycha Labs appears to be the AI products arm.

## fridayai.online: 121-tenant SaaS exposure (`148.113.212.12`)

OVH Canada host, TLS SAN `fridayai.online`. 121 distinct workspace collections (`ws-XXX` UUIDs), plus a `conversation_archive` collection.

Largest workspaces:

| Collection | Points |
|---|---:|
| `ws-e6de74b1aaa8a683` | 116,401 |
| `ws-09d50e7a263d7f14` | 105,076 |
| `ws-6086420ff2d6d36f` | 59,041 |
| `ws-07fc084d74893079` | 46,733 |
| `ws-12ff6cc3ac637b3d` | 45,781 |
| `ws-dcaf72656044ac22` | 34,626 |
| `ws-57acd9f3a0a1a695` | 31,094 |
| `ws-dc1c04a01e6370de` | 27,721 |
| `ws-6a6c9569e4ffa1dc` | 21,904 |
| `ws-12fa45e33cdaac2d` | 16,171 |

The `ws-XXX` naming convention plus the count is the signature of a multi-tenant SaaS where each customer gets a workspace identifier. 121 customers' RAG data exposed to the internet on a single Qdrant cluster.

Adjacent ports are alarming: **MongoDB (27017)**, **Redis (6379)**, **kubelet (10250)**, exposed kubelet enables container-RCE on the Kubernetes node hosting all 121 workspaces. The data layer breach is one issue; the kubelet exposure means container escape to root on the cluster node is also reachable.

---

## vector.jezt.cloud: Multi-tenant SaaS, 264 collections

`35.154.114.115` (AWS Mumbai, TLS SAN `vector.jezt.cloud`). 10.7M points across 264 collections. Many of the collection names look like daily snapshots (`UV_special_1025_DDMMYYYY` running January through April 2026) and template data (`Json_data_NNNN`, `Unk_Rein_NNNN`). The `media_dubai_<uuid>` collections imply a Dubai-region media/PR customer dataset.

---

## Weaviate cohort items (other than RefugeeContent)

The Weaviate schema endpoint's `pii_fields` tagging revealed additional self-declared sensitive-data classes across the 127-host cohort:

| Host | Class | Self-declared PII fields |
|---|---|---|
| `141.94.237.69` | RefugeeContent | source_username, geo_address, geo_phones, geo_emails |
| `20.70.178.199` | MeetingTranscript / MeetingAI / CorrectionDelta | user_id, userId |
| `34.1.233.6` | EmployerBranding / Job / JobAzure | customer_id, city |
| `144.76.99.45` | LegalDocument / LegalDocumentChunk | court_name |
| `146.190.41.226` | Document / Sapb1dbdocs | original_filename, stored_filename, table_name |
| `164.90.195.110` | DocumentChunkBIS | user_id |
| `213.199.59.36` | DocumentChunk / Forge_memory / Test_memory | document_name |
| `109.123.243.170` | Documents | client_name |
| `100.42.179.216` | AssistantData / HistoryData | doc_name |
| `101.34.239.12` | QwenDocs | account_id |
| `118.145.107.162` | PolicyDocument | fileName |

The `pii_fields` declaration is a Weaviate schema feature operators *opt into*. Each of these hosts is a case where the operator has *acknowledged in code* that the class holds PII, and then exposed it without authentication. Twenty-three hosts in this Weaviate cohort had at least one class with non-empty `pii_fields`.

---

## Method

1. **Shodan harvest:** 6 protocol-strict dorks (`http.html:"qdrant"`, `product:"Weaviate"`, `port:8080+weaviate`, `product:"Milvus"`, `product:"Chroma"`, `port:8000+chroma`). Union: 917 candidates.
2. **aimap port scan:** 917 × 12 ports = 11,004 probe targets. 2,366 open ports surfaced.
3. **aimap fingerprint:** 699 service hits, 263 unique IPs identified across the four vendors.
4. **Per-vendor deep enumeration:** Qdrant `/collections` for point counts, Weaviate `/v1/schema` for collection schemas including `pii_fields`, ChromaDB `/api/v1/collections`, Milvus collection list.
5. **Restraint:** schema + metadata only. No `_search`, no `query`, no document reads. The class names and point counts are the finding.

---

## Disclosure pipeline

Three tiers:

**Tier 1. Critical, single-instance, humanitarian or large-scale PII:**
- `141.94.237.69` (RefugeeContent) → OVH abuse + operator-identification effort. Top priority.
- `103.247.10.156` (aishelter.underdog.my.id) → Rumahweb Indonesia abuse + operator. PII at scale.
- `148.113.212.12` (fridayai.online) → OVH Canada abuse + operator. 121 third-party customers affected; the operator must notify each.

**Tier 2. Large but single-organization:**
- `89.108.123.166` (advocat-online.ru) → Reg.Ru abuse + operator. Legal services data. Sensitive but single-operator.
- `204.10.144.25` (kaychalabs.com) → Revelex security + Kaycha Labs operator. Internal corporate.
- `20.127.155.10` (eclipseassistance.azure) → Microsoft Azure abuse + operator. Internal test data.

**Tier 3. Weaviate PII-self-declared cohort (23 hosts):**
- Batch report to each respective hosting provider (OVH, Hetzner, DigitalOcean, GCP, AWS) listing affected customer IPs with the per-class `pii_fields` declarations.
