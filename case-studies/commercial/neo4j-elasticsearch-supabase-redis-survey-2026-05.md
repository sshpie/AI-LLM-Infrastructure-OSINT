# Neo4j, Elasticsearch, Supabase, Redis Stack: AI Infrastructure Exposure Survey

_ · 2026-05-09_

---

## Summary

Four additional infrastructure layers surveyed as part of the 2026-05-09 vector DB series. Combined Shodan pull → asyncio probe across 2,064 IPs (971 Neo4j + 636 Elasticsearch v8 + 314 Supabase + 143 Redis Stack).

## DCWF KSAT coverage

Auto-derived from DCWF AI work-role rule files (`ksat-tag`).

- **672 (AI Test & Evaluation Specialist):** K7003, K7044, S7068, S7075, T5904
- **733 (AI Risk & Ethics Specialist):** K7051, T5868, T5893, T5904
- **overlap (Common AI KSATs (all 5 roles)):** K108, K1158, K22, K6311, K6935, K7003, K7048, K942

<!-- ksat-tag:auto-generated:end -->

**Elasticsearch is the headline finding:** 958 reachable, **920 unauthenticated** (96% open rate), and **817 of those 920 unauth instances (89%) have been ransomed**. A single active campaign has wiped data and planted `read_me` ransom notes across the majority of exposed clusters. One confirmed v8.16.0 instance is serving live vector search workloads (BGE-M3 multilingual embeddings) without auth. **Neo4j** shows 971 open instances, all presenting their HTTP browser interface. V4+ moved to Bolt protocol, making HTTP-based probing incomplete. **Redis Stack** RedisInsight UI is 100% unauthenticated across 112 confirmed instances. **Supabase** self-hosted exposure is minimal (23 reachable, 5 unauth REST).

## Elasticsearch

### Methodology

```
shodan download --limit 1500 elasticsearch-v8.json.gz 'product:"Elastic" port:9200 version:8'
  → 636 unique IPs

asyncio probe (80 concurrent):
  GET  http://{ip}:9200/              → 200 = unauth (version, cluster_name)
                                      → 401 = auth gated
  GET  http://{ip}:9200/_cat/indices?format=json&h=index,docs.count
                                      → index list
  GET  http://{ip}:9200/{idx}/_mapping → check for dense_vector / knn
```

### Results

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| IPs probed | 636 |
| Confirmed reachable | **958** |
| **Unauthenticated** | **920** (96%) |
| Auth-gated | 38 |
| Ransomed (read_me index) | **817** (89% of unauth) |
| Vector workload confirmed | **1** |

### Version Distribution (unauth instances)

| Major version | Count |
|---|---|
| v7.x | 910 |
| v8.x | 8 |
| v9.x | 2 |

The Elasticsearch v7 dominance reflects the version where the security-by-default change was not yet in effect. Elasticsearch made TLS + auth mandatory by default starting with **v8.0.0 (2022-02)**. The 920 unauth instances are overwhelmingly v7.x deployments that shipped with security off and were never hardened.

### Ransom Campaign (Active)

**817 of 920 unauth instances have been compromised.** The attack pattern is consistent: attacker connected to the open ES API, deleted all indices, created a `read_me` index containing a ransom note. Confirmed campaign IOCs:

```
BTC wallet:  bc1q38rjul6gdamfflf6p4ukz0ymtvfgfv2j9saf6r
Contact:     wendy.etabw@gmx.com (include your unique code)
Demand:      0.0041 BTC (~$250 USD)
```

Top cluster names in ransomed set: `docker-cluster` (407), `elasticsearch` (231), `my-application` (17), `es-cluster` (15), `my-cluster` (11). The cluster name distribution, dominated by defaults, confirms these are misconfigured deployments that were never properly commissioned.

### Notable Findings

---

#### F1: Fintech payment ledger (CRITICAL)

**Host:** `103.21.89.153` (AS group, likely APAC cloud)  
**Severity:** CRITICAL. Financial transaction data exposed, then ransomed

Confirmed indices before ransom completion: `withdraw_records`, `recharge_records`, `wallet_operations`. Cluster name `my-cluster`, version v7.17.29. This is an active fintech or crypto payment processing backend. All three index names map directly to core ledger operations (withdrawals, recharges/deposits, wallet state). The ransom note (`read_me`) coexists with the data indices, suggesting either partial wipe or data was exfiltrated before deletion.

```bash
curl http://103.21.89.153:9200/_cat/indices?format=json&h=index
# Returns: withdraw_records, read_me, recharge_records, wallet_operations
```

---

#### F2: Mastodon social network index (MEDIUM)

**Host:** `103.76.196.22`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM. Social network user/post data exposed and ransomed

Cluster name `mastodon-es`, version v7.17.8. Mastodon instances use Elasticsearch for full-text search across posts, users, and accounts. The cluster name confirms this is an ES backend for a Mastodon instance. Content indexed typically includes: post text, account bios, hashtags, user search indexes. Now fully ransomed (only `read_me` index remaining).

---

#### F3: Confirmed vector search workload (MEDIUM)

**Host:** `39.102.213.167`  
**Version:** v8.16.0 (Elasticsearch)  
**Cluster:** `docker-cluster`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM. Vector search index exposed without auth

Only confirmed v8.x instance with unauthenticated access AND confirmed vector workload. Indices: `search_keywords_bge-m3`, `global_search_keywords_bge-m3`. BGE-M3 (BAAI General Embedding, multilingual) is a dense vector embedding model widely used for semantic search in Chinese/multilingual applications. The `global_` prefix suggests this is a production search layer for a web application with multilingual query support.

```bash
curl http://39.102.213.167:9200/search_keywords_bge-m3/_mapping | jq '..|.type?//empty' | sort -u
# Expected: dense_vector, keyword, long, text
```

The BGE-M3 model produces 1024-dimension vectors. Exposed data likely includes: search query vectors (corpus-poisoning surface), indexed content embeddings (semantic inference of indexed documents), and mapping schema (reveals data model of the parent application).

### Auth Posture Analysis

Elasticsearch's security evolution is directly visible in this data:

- **v6.x and earlier:** No security features in the free tier (X-Pack Security was paid-only). Zero-auth was the only option without licensing.
- **v7.x:** Security features added to free tier (7.1+) but disabled by default. The docker-cluster naming pattern indicates docker-compose deployments that almost never enable security.
- **v8.x:** Security enabled by default for new installations. The 8 unauth v8.x instances represent deliberate `xpack.security.enabled: false` configuration or legacy upgrades that didn't inherit the new defaults.

The ransom campaign targeting is rational: 89% of exposed clusters had already been found and wiped before this survey. The remaining 11% (103 instances) have not yet been hit, or the data was insufficiently valuable to ransom.

## Neo4j

### Methodology

```
shodan download neo4j.json.gz 'product:"Neo4j"'
  → 971 unique IPs

asyncio probe:
  GET  http://{ip}:7474/           → 200/401 = HTTP browser open
  GET  http://{ip}:7474/db/data/   → legacy REST (v3 and earlier)
  GET  http://{ip}:7474/db/data/ + BasicAuth neo4j:neo4j → default creds check
```

### Results

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| IPs probed | 971 |
| HTTP browser open (:7474) | **971** |
| Legacy REST unauth | 971 (all return 200 on /db/data/) |
| Default creds (neo4j/neo4j) | 0 |
| Version fingerprinted | 0 |

### Probe Limitation: Bolt Protocol

Neo4j migrated its primary client protocol to **Bolt** (binary, port 7687) in v4.0 (2020). The HTTP REST API (`/db/data/`) was deprecated in v4.0 and removed in v5.0. The asyncio HTTP probe correctly identifies that port 7474 (the Neo4j Browser UI) is open, but:

1. **Version** cannot be extracted via the deprecated REST path. All 971 instances return `version: null`
2. **Default credentials** cannot be validated via HTTP POST. The deprecated endpoint returns HTTP 200 but doesn't validate creds the same way
3. **Actual database access** requires a Bolt client (`neo4j-driver`, Cypher shell, or raw websocket) on port 7687

The 971 "unauth" flags in this survey indicate the Neo4j Browser web UI is publicly reachable. Not that the database is accessible without credentials. The Browser UI itself requires authentication, and modern Neo4j (v5+) enforces RBAC with no anonymous access path.

**What the 971 open Neo4j Browser instances represent:**
- The web UI is exposed (allows credential-stuffing/brute-force attempts)
- Port 7687 (Bolt) may be exposed separately. Not probed in this survey
- Default `neo4j:neo4j` credentials remain a viable attack path via Bolt clients
- Some fraction will have changed the password, some will not

**Revised assessment:** This survey undercounts Neo4j risk. The HTTP browser probe is a reachability signal, not an auth state signal for v4+. A follow-up survey using a Bolt protocol probe (via `neo4j` Python driver or direct WebSocket) is required to determine actual unauth state.

## Supabase (Self-Hosted)

### Methodology

```
shodan download supabase.json.gz 'http.title:"Supabase"'
  → 314 unique IPs

asyncio probe:
  GET  http://{ip}:8000/           → Kong gateway presence
  GET  http://{ip}:8000/rest/v1/   → PostgREST unauth check
  Check for anon key leak in HTML
```

### Results

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| IPs probed | 314 |
| Reachable | **23** |
| **PostgREST unauth** | **5** |
| Anon key in HTML | 0 |

The low hit count reflects Supabase's architecture: the managed cloud product (`supabase.com`) uses dedicated infrastructure that Shodan fingerprints differently. Self-hosted Supabase on port 8000 (Kong API gateway) is less common than the managed service.

The 5 unauth instances expose the PostgREST API directly. `GET /rest/v1/` returns HTTP 200, meaning table-level access is possible without the `anon` key. This typically indicates a misconfigured Kong route or a Supabase deployment where the `apikey` enforcement middleware was removed.

**Unauth Supabase PostgREST exposure:**
```
178.156.202.116:8000
157.180.79.165:8000
204.168.183.239:8000
204.168.201.75:8000
141.164.63.237:8000
```

Supabase's anon key, normally required for all public API calls, is tied to Row Level Security (RLS) policies. Without the key, RLS still applies if configured, but **tables without RLS policies are fully readable/writable by any unauthenticated client** via the PostgREST endpoint.

---

## Redis Stack / RedisInsight

### Methodology

```
shodan download redis-stack.json.gz 'product:"RedisInsight" port:8001'
  → 143 unique IPs

asyncio probe:
  GET  http://{ip}:8001/           → RedisInsight UI (200 = open)
  GET  http://{ip}:8001/api/instance/ → instance list (confirms unauth)
```

### Results

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| IPs probed | 143 |
| RedisInsight UI open | **112** |
| **Unauthenticated (100%)** | **112** |
| Instance list accessible | ~112 |

**RedisInsight is 100% unauthenticated across all 112 confirmed instances.** RedisInsight ships with no authentication by default. It is designed as a local development tool and assumes the host is trusted. When exposed on a public IP, it provides:

- Full Redis database browser (key-value browse, search, JSON, streams)
- Workbench with live Redis command execution
- Profiler and memory analysis
- **For Redis Stack instances:** RediSearch, RedisJSON, RedisGraph, RedisTimeSeries, RedisBloom module access via GUI

A publicly accessible RedisInsight is equivalent to unauthenticated `redis-cli` access. Read, write, delete on any key. For AI/ML workloads, Redis Stack is used for vector similarity search (RediSearch `VECTOR` field type), session storage, and caching LLM outputs. RedisInsight exposure means full access to these data classes.

**RedisInsight added optional authentication in v2.x** (`RI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var for data-at-rest, but no HTTP auth layer until the 2024 enterprise features). Most deployments do not set the encryption key.

**Sample confirmed open instances:**
```
104.237.136.86:8001
129.212.183.88:8001
138.197.96.54:8001
109.123.245.210:8001
109.245.220.210:8001
```
