# sanctionscanner.com: Turkish AML/KYC Compliance SaaS: 79M KYB Records + Live Client Monitoring Exposed

_ · 2026-05-03_

---

## Summary

sanctionscanner.com is a Turkish AML/KYC compliance SaaS serving financial institutions. Their production Elasticsearch cluster, three nodes, was reachable on port 9200 with `xpack.security.enabled=false` and no network firewall. The cluster holds 79 million Know Your Business (KYB) company records, 6.2 million individual sanctions/watchlist records, 877K document-number records, and two live client monitoring queries screening real persons in real time. A prior automated ransomware bot already found it, a `read_me` extortion index is present.  independently confirmed full read access without credentials.

## Index Inventory

| Index | Document count | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `kyb_data_index_prod` | 79,067,927 | KYB company records |
| `allsearchindexv2prod` | 6,230,703 | Individual sanctions/watchlist records |
| `documentsearchindexprod` | 877,138 | Document number records (tax IDs, reg numbers) |
| `ongoing_monitoring_organization_2_queries` | 2 | Live client screening queries |
| `read_me` | 1 | Extortion demand (prior attacker) |

---

## Findings

### F1: 79M KYB Company Records Unauthenticated (CRITICAL)

`kyb_data_index_prod` is fully readable. Records cross-reference global business registries against sanctions lists, the core commercial product.

Proof:
```
GET http://168.119.90.62:9200/kyb_data_index_prod/_search?size=3
HTTP 200 - live records returned, no authentication
```

Sample record fields:
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "companyName": "...",
  "companyNumber": "...",
  "cleanFullName": "...",
  "status": "...",
  "establishmentDate": "...",
  "listTypeId": "...",
  "matchRate": "...",
  "isDeleted": false
}
```

Observed sample: Colombian business registry entities cross-referenced against sanctions lists. The `matchRate` field indicates sanctions-screening score for each entity.

GDPR Article 9 applies where natural persons are identifiable through company records (sole traders, beneficial owners, etc.).

---

### F2: 6.2M Individual Sanctions/Watchlist Records Unauthenticated (CRITICAL)

`allsearchindexv2prod` contains individual records sourced from global sanctions and watchlist databases.

Sample record fields:
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "fullName": "...",
  "cleanFullName": "...",
  "nationalities": [...],
  "listId": "...",
  "typeId": "...",
  "isIndividual": true,
  "createdDate": "..."
}
```

`listId` references OFAC SDN, EU Consolidated List, UN Security Council, and PEP databases. Exposure of this index enables:
- Enumeration of which sanctioned individuals are in the screening corpus
- Identification of persons whose names return no match (negative screening intelligence)
- PEP list membership inference, special-category data under GDPR Article 9

---

### F3: Live Client Monitoring Queries Expose Real Persons Being Screened (HIGH)

`ongoing_monitoring_organization_2_queries` contains active screening jobs submitted by a sanctionscanner.com client (organizationId: 2).

Sample record:
```json
{
  "id": 20,
  "cleanQueryString": "ADEM YILMAZ",
  "listType": 1,
  "organizationId": 2,
  "period": 1
}
```

This discloses: which real persons a financial institution is actively monitoring, the institution's customer/counterparty list in aggregate, and the monitoring cadence (`period`). This is live operational data from a paying client, not historical. A second query record is also present.

---

### F4: Prior Ransomware Extortion Index Present (HIGH)

The `read_me` index was written by an automated Elasticsearch ransomware bot before 's discovery.  did not place this index.

Extortion note content:
- Demanded 0.0041 BTC to `bc1q38rjul6gdamfflf6p4ukz0ymtvfgfv2j9saf6r`
- Contact address: `wendy.etabw@gmx.com`
- Consistent with the Meow/ElasticSearch ransomware campaign pattern

Implication: the cluster was already found, accessed, and potentially exfiltrated before this disclosure. GDPR Article 33 (72-hour breach notification) obligations are therefore likely already triggered regardless of whether the operator paid the ransom, the data was accessible to an unauthenticated third party with sufficient time to operate.

---

### F5: Root Cause: xpack.security Disabled Cluster-Wide (CRITICAL)

All three nodes (es01, es02, es03) share the same Docker Compose configuration with:
```yaml
ES_JAVA_OPTS: "-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
xpack.security.enabled: "false"
network.host: "0.0.0.0"
```

`network.host=0.0.0.0` binds port 9200 to all interfaces including the public NIC. `xpack.security.enabled=false` disables the Elasticsearch native authentication layer. The combination is the standard misconfiguration responsible for the majority of Elasticsearch mass-exposure incidents since 2017.

---

## Regulatory Context

| Framework | Relevant provision |
|---|---|
| GDPR | Article 9, special category data (sanctions/PEP status is sensitive); Article 33, breach notification within 72h where exfiltration cannot be ruled out |
| FATF Recommendation 10 | Customer due diligence data must be protected; exposure of KYB/KYC screening results undermines AML integrity |
| Turkish KVKK | Law No. 6698, Article 12, data controller must take technical measures to prevent unauthorized access |

---

## Remediation

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml - apply to all three nodes
environment:
  - xpack.security.enabled=true
  - xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled=true
  - network.host=_local_
```

Rotate all Elasticsearch credentials post-fix. Audit access logs from the prior-attacker window. File GDPR Article 33 notification with applicable supervisory authority if exfiltration cannot be excluded.
