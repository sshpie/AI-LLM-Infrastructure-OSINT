## Summary

The morning's `_mapping` probe surfaced 22 Elasticsearch hosts with `dense_vector` or `knn_vector` fields. Those are unambiguous AI / RAG workloads. We ran cert-pivot, Shodan, and `aimap-profile` on each one.

## DCWF KSAT coverage

Auto-derived from DCWF AI work-role rule files (`ksat-tag`).

Three findings.

**One. `103.69.124.214` is Nepal's Ministry of Health and Population.** The TLS cert SAN is `ocl.hmis.gov.np`. That host is the Open Concept Lab, Nepal's clinical-terminology server. `crt.sh` returns 10 subdomains under `hmis.gov.np` including `fhir.hmis.gov.np` (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources gateway), `elmis.hmis.gov.np` (vaccine + drug logistics), `erecord.hmis.gov.np` (electronic records), and `sudurpashchim.hmis.gov.np` (Far-Western Province deployment).

The exposed host carries 318,114 clinical-concept documents with embeddings (drug names, diagnoses, ICD-10 codes), an admin `user_profiles` index, and a Meow `read_me` marker. The attacker planted the marker. The data is still alive. Disclosure went to NP-CERT and the Ministry of Health.

**Two. 18 of 22 AI-stack hosts (82%) carry an extortion marker.** Seven are fully wiped. Eleven are mid-wipe with original data still alive. The hospital host from yesterday (`106.75.127.240`) is one of the eleven. Its 270,000 patient-record vector indices are intact. The attacker has not yet deleted them.

**Three. 17 of 22 hosts attributed to named operators.** NewsBlur. XiaoIce. TorchV on ZLMediaKit. Hooper ERP. AItalkx. Tahakum AI. Guangxi OTA. TimeDB. isideweb. Equant Tech (Waffarha LMS). Each has a clean disclosure routing.

## The Nepal HMIS finding

The TLS cert on `103.69.124.214:443` carries the SAN `ocl.hmis.gov.np`. We probed `crt.sh` on `*.hmis.gov.np` and got back the full government health-system footprint.

| Subdomain | Role (inferred from name) |
|---|---|
| `hmis.gov.np` | Root. Health Management Information System. |
| `dashboard.hmis.gov.np` | Operations dashboard |
| `elmis.hmis.gov.np` | electronic Logistics Management. Vaccines, drugs, supply chain. |
| `elmis-reports.hmis.gov.np` | eLMIS reporting |
| `erecord.hmis.gov.np` | Electronic Records |
| `fhir.hmis.gov.np` | FHIR healthcare-interoperability gateway |
| `monitoring.hmis.gov.np` | System monitoring |
| `ocl.hmis.gov.np` | Open Concept Lab. Our exposed host. |
| `pss.hmis.gov.np` | Patient/provider service (inferred) |
| `sudurpashchim.hmis.gov.np` | Far-Western Province deployment |

The exposed host's indices:

| Index | Documents | Size | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `concepts` | 318,114 | 27.7 MB | OCL clinical-concept dictionary with `_embeddings.vector` and `_synonyms_embeddings.vector` |
| `mappings` | 3,806 | 813 KB | Concept-to-code mappings |
| `collections` | 87 | 31.6 KB | Concept-collection metadata |
| `organizations` | 3 | 9.3 KB | Org records |
| `sources` | 29 | 22.6 KB | Source vocabulary records |
| `user_profiles` | 9 | 11.2 KB | Admin / curator accounts |
| `url_registries` | 0 | 249 B | Empty |
| `read_me` | 112 | 122.8 KB | Meow extortion marker. Attacker-planted. |

We did not read documents in any index. Per the restraint ethic, the schema itself is the finding. The 318,114 concept documents and the 9 admin profiles are alive. The attacker has planted his marker but has not deleted.

WHOIS on the IP returns `Department of Information Technology, Government of Nepal`. Disclosure went to NP-CERT (`incident@npcert.org.np`) with the Ministry CC'd.

## Other named operators

### NewsBlur (`135.125.201.31`)

Cluster `newsblur-local`. Index `discover-stories-openai-index` with `content_vector` field at 256d. That is OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` with the `dimensions=256` parameter. NewsBlur's "discover stories" feature reads off this index. Mid-wipe. Disclosure went to Samuel Clay.

### gxota.com (`112.124.16.227`)

53 SAN subdomains. Multi-tenant Guangxi tourism SaaS with regional subsidiaries: car rental (`zuche.ztc.gxota.com`), business center API (`bizcenter-api.gxota.com`), retail (`byhshop.gxota.com`), provincial tourism brands (Sanjiang, Wuye, QiuYouLuYou). Six Chinese tourism knowledge bases at 1024d. Not wiped.

### XiaoIce demo (`8.147.113.203`)

Cluster `xiaoicedemo`. Index `prod_virtualhuman_knowledge_faq_default_org` at 512d. XiaoIce is the Microsoft-spinoff Chinese AI companion product. The "demo" cluster name fronts production virtual-human FAQ data. Mid-wipe.

### TravelM candidate (`84.247.170.209`)

Contabo Germany. Traefik default cert (no SNI binding). Indices `article_de`, `article_en`, `article_es`, `article_fr`, `article_it`, `article_ru` at 1536d (OpenAI text-embedding-3-large truncated). The earlier passive sweep returned `ai.travelm.de` on Shodan. Mid-wipe.

### The synthetic-character operator (`212.64.24.141`)

Tencent Cloud Shanghai. Ancient ES 3.5.0. No cert. Eleven indices form a synthetic-character production pipeline:

`material_ambient`, `material_background`, `material_character_appearance`, `material_subject_appearance`, `material_emotion_effect`, `material_music`, `material_voicefx`, `material_subject`, `resource_background`, `resource_music`.

All `knn_vector` at 1024d. The schema names a virtual-influencer / digital-human content-generation pipeline. ES 3.5.0 is pre-X-Pack with public unauthenticated RCEs (CVE-2014-3120, CVE-2015-1427). Mid-wipe.

## Embedding dimension as a provider signal

| Dim | Likely model | Hosts |
|---|---|---:|
| 256 | OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (reduced) | 1 (NewsBlur) |
| 384 | sentence-transformers `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | 2 (Tahakum, Russian News) |
| 512 | OpenAI `text-embedding-ada-001` (legacy), `text-embedding-3-small` truncated | 1 (XiaoIce) |
| 768 | OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (full), `bge-base`, `m3e-base` | 5 (incl. Nepal, hospital, Haystack dev, AItalkx) |
| 1024 | Cohere `embed-v3`, `bge-large` | 12 (most Chinese operators) |
| 1536 | OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large` (truncated), `text-embedding-ada-002` | 5 |

Chinese operators sit mostly at 768d and 1024d (open-source bge / m3e models). Western operators sit mostly at 256d, 1536d, 3072d (OpenAI). The dimension reads off which LLM API the operator is paying for.

## Disclosure status

Sent today:

1. NP-CERT + Nepal MoHP. CRITICAL.
2. UCloud Shanghai abuse for the hospital host (`106.75.127.240`). CRITICAL.
3. NewsBlur (Samuel Clay). HIGH.
4. GMX abuse for `wendy.etabw@gmx.com`. HIGH.
5. Correction to UCloud naming Actor C (not Actor A). HIGH.
6. onionmail.org abuse for `scandal@onionmail.org`. HIGH.
7. sharebot.net abuse for `db-recovery@sharebot.net`. HIGH.

Queued, not yet sent: the remaining 13 named operators on the table above. Each needs a per-host re-probe and per-actor classification before send.
