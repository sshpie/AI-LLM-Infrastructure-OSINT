# Data Labeling / Annotation Servers: Cross-Cloud Survey (2026-05)

_ · 2026-05-04 (in progress)_

> **Status:** Discovery + deep-probe complete (2026-05-04). **348 confirmed cross-cloud, ~99% auth-on at content endpoints, auth-off-default thesis breaks at the data-labeling tier**. Single-platform dominance: every confirmed instance is `doccano`.

---

## Premise

Data-labeling and annotation servers (Argilla, LabelStudio, Prodigy, doccano, CVAT) sit at the **input boundary of every supervised-learning ML pipeline**. They host the raw data being labeled, frequently real customer PII, internal documents, facial imagery, medical scans, support-ticket transcripts, financial filings, and the labeling-team workforce metadata.

Operators stand them up quickly to crowd-source annotation, then forget to lock them down before walking away from the project. The auth posture varies sharply by platform:

- **Argilla** ships with auth on by default since v1.x, but anonymous workspaces and `default-public` settings are common in tutorial deployments.
- **LabelStudio** ships with mandatory auth out-of-the-box, but operator-deployed-without-RBAC instances expose `/api/projects` reads.
- **Prodigy** has **no built-in auth**, operators are expected to bolt on a reverse proxy. They often don't.
- **doccano** has auth but its `/v1/projects` endpoint can be made public for collaborative annotation.
- **CVAT** has auth on by default, but `/api/server/about` and project listing are sometimes left readable.

The auth-on-default thesis predicts: **Prodigy will be 100% unauth at population scale (no auth concept). The others will trend lower.** This survey tests that prediction.

## Methodology

### Discovery

Same tier-2 cross-cloud pattern as the existing surveys: Scaleway 7 + OVH 33 + Linode 36 = 76 prefixes ≈ 3.55M IPs.

Ports scanned: **6900** (Argilla default), **8000** (doccano default), **8080** (LabelStudio / CVAT / Prodigy reverse-proxy default).

Note: ports 8000 and 8080 collide with **dozens** of other AI platforms (vLLM, OpenAI-compat servers, MCP HTTP+SSE, Airflow, Spark UI, Weaviate, etc.). Platform identification therefore relies on **response signatures**, not port alone.

### Probe

`data/datalabel-probe.py` is a multi-platform fingerprint prober. For each (ip, port), it tries each platform's distinctive endpoint in turn:

| Platform | Probe endpoint | Match signature |
|---|---|---|
| **Argilla** | `GET /api/_info` | JSON with `version` + `elasticsearch` keys |
| **LabelStudio** | `GET /version` | JSON with `release` and `label-studio-os-*` keys |
| **doccano** | `GET /v1/health` + `GET /v1/projects` | health responds; `/v1/projects` returns paginated `{count, results}` |
| **CVAT** | `GET /api/server/about` | JSON with `name` containing "Computer Vision Annotation Tool" |
| **Prodigy** | `GET /` | HTML body containing `prodigy` markers |

For each confirmed instance, capture: platform, version, project/workspace count (if reachable unauth), auth posture (401/403 or 200 on `/api/projects`), raw match signature.

### Filters

- **AS63949 honeypot fleet**, apply standard filter (393-host Akamai/Linode honeypot list at `~/recon/ollama-tier2-2026-05-04/as63949-honeypot-fleet.txt`).
- **Common port-8080 false positives**, anything that returns Spark/Airflow/Weaviate signatures is excluded by the probe's signature-matching (those don't return Argilla/LabelStudio/CVAT JSON shapes).
- **Auth-on-default instances**, record presence (`auth_required: true`) but exclude from the "exposed projects/data" enumeration.

### Tools-classification taxonomy

For each confirmed unauth instance, classify by what kind of data the project metadata reveals:

| Class | Examples | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **Healthcare / clinical** | radiology images, EHR text, drug-trial transcripts | HIPAA / GDPR Art. 9 |
| **Financial / KYC** | identity documents, transaction logs, AML-flagged content | PCI / regional financial-data laws |
| **Government / law-enforcement** | police body-cam, surveillance footage, immigration docs | jurisdiction-dependent |
| **Personal / consumer** | user-generated content, customer support transcripts, social-media DMs | GDPR / CCPA |
| **Facial / biometric** | face recognition training, age-detection, emotion-tagging | GDPR Art. 9 (biometric special-category) |
| **NLP corpus** | document classification, NER, sentiment | mostly low risk unless internal docs |
| **Computer vision (non-faces)** | object detection, segmentation, retail | low to medium |
| **Internal-business** | invoices, contracts, ID cards from operator's own org | confidentiality + sometimes PII |

---

## Discovery results

Cross-cloud final. Masscan port 6900 (Argilla); ports 8000 + 8080 reused from MCP and LLM Gateway scans.

| Source | Probe targets | Confirmed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Combined tier-2 (3 providers) | (large) | **348** | Single-platform sweep, all 348 are doccano |

### By platform

| Platform | Confirmed | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **doccano** | **348** (100%) | NLP text-annotation Django app; all surfaced via `/v1/health` returning JSON status + `/v1/projects` returning paginated `{count, results}` shape |
| Argilla | 0 | None confirmed in tier-2 sample. Suggests Argilla operators deploy with auth-on or behind reverse-proxy hygiene; or low overall population in this hosting tier. |
| LabelStudio | 0 | Same, none surfaced. LabelStudio's commercial tier (Heartex) likely dominates the deployment population, with the hosted-cloud version not in our scan scope. |
| Prodigy | 0 | Prodigy operators tend to deploy with reverse-proxy auth; the no-auth-by-default catches few public hosts. |
| CVAT | 0 | CVAT is more commonly deployed in K8s clusters than cheap-VPS infrastructure; out of our scan profile. |

The **single-platform dominance** is itself the headline finding for this tier. doccano is the data-labeling tool that consistently surfaces in cheap-cloud / single-VPS deployments; the others either have better default-auth, deploy in different infrastructure tiers, or have smaller install bases.

## Notable findings

### F1: Single-platform dominance: 348 of 348 are doccano

The data-labeling tier in tier-2 cloud is a single-platform population. No Argilla, LabelStudio, Prodigy, or CVAT confirmed in any of the 1,017 prefix scans. doccano (Python/Django, BSD-licensed, popular for NLP annotation) is the de-facto open-source choice for solo / small-team operators on cheap VPS infrastructure.

### F2: Auth-on at content endpoints: ~99% rate

Deep-probe at `/v1/projects` returned **HTTP 401/403 across 344 of 348 hosts** (98.9%). doccano ships with mandatory auth and the operator population overwhelmingly keeps that default. The `/v1/health` fingerprint endpoint stays open (which is how the survey discovered them), but the project + label data is consistently locked.

### F3: `/openapi.json` exposure: 20 hosts (5.7%)

A small subset (20 of 348) leak the OpenAPI route map at `/openapi.json`. Same disclosure shape as the RAG framework finding, full API design + Pydantic schemas readable, but no actual content access. Reconnaissance value but not direct data exfil.

### F4: Auth-off-default thesis breaks at the data-labeling tier

Same shape as the RAG framework finding: data-labeling tools ship as **end-user applications** (with login flows, project ownership, collaborator roles), operators keep auth on. This contrasts with the inference / vector DB / gateway tier where auth-off-default reproduces at population scale.

### F5: Negative finding for Argilla / LabelStudio / Prodigy / CVAT in this hosting tier

Zero confirmed instances of any non-doccano platform in 1,017 scanned prefixes. Three possible interpretations:

1. These platforms have effective default-auth at the fingerprint endpoint, our probe couldn't detect them
2. Their operator populations deploy in different infrastructure tiers (managed cloud, K8s, on-prem)
3. Genuinely smaller install base in the small-VPS-operator audience this survey covers

Likely a mix of (1) and (2). LabelStudio commercial-cloud is heavily promoted; CVAT runs in K8s clusters; Argilla's HuggingFace integration tilts adoption toward HuggingFace Spaces rather than self-hosted VPS.

---

## Threat classes

1. **Direct dataset exfil**, when `/api/projects` is unauth, the project list discloses operator identity, business domain, and (often) the actual labeled records.
2. **PII leak via raw labeling content**, annotation projects routinely contain customer support transcripts with names + emails + phones, medical records, identity documents.
3. **Biometric data exposure** (GDPR Art. 9), facial-recognition labeling projects expose face crops + identifiers; same regulatory class as the tweet-optimize.com Milvus finding.
4. **Annotator credential leak**, some platforms expose user lists, sometimes with email + role.
5. **Model fingerprinting**, Argilla integrates with HuggingFace models; the project schema reveals which models the operator is fine-tuning.
6. **Operational intel**, the "label classes" defined in a project disclose the operator's classification taxonomy (often proprietary business logic).

---

## Honest negative space

- **Authenticated platforms with read-only public projects**, some operators intentionally publish public-domain corpora via Argilla/doccano. Manual review needed to distinguish "intentional public" from "misconfigured."
- **Reverse-proxied Prodigy**, Prodigy's no-auth-by-design is mitigated when operators correctly add nginx + basic-auth in front. Those return 401 at the network edge and are out of scope (but the proxy + Prodigy combination is the recommended deployment path; population data on whether operators actually do it is the survey's value-add).
- **CVAT enterprise / SaaS deployments**, the SaaS-hosted version (cvat.ai) is auth-on by design; this survey targets self-hosted instances only.

---

## Disclosure plan

For each unauthenticated instance with high-risk content classes (healthcare, financial, biometric, government), draft coordinated-disclosure email per the standard  template, routed via WHOIS-derived institution identification (per the contact-resolver rule from the Buffalo State misroute lesson).
