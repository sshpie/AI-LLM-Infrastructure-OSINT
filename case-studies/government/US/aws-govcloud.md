## Findings

### F1: US Government-Contracted AWS Infrastructure Exposed (CRITICAL)

AWS GovCloud is used exclusively by US federal agencies, state governments with federal contracts, and their contractors. FedRAMP-authorized. Port 11434 (Ollama) publicly accessible without authentication from the open internet means any actor can query, enumerate, and inject models on what is contractually government infrastructure.

### F2: Custom AI Persona: JOSIE (HIGH)

`JOSIE` (Just One Super Intelligent Entity) is a custom Ollama model by HuggingFace user `goekdenizguelmez` running on a US GovCloud EC2 instance. System prompt fully exposed. The presence of a community-sourced custom persona model on government infrastructure suggests either a developer's personal deployment in a government-contracted AWS account, or a test environment without network controls.

### F3: Cloud Proxy Quota Exposure (HIGH)

`deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` and `minimax-m2.7:cloud` expose paid API subscriptions over an unauthenticated port. Cloud proxy 401 responses were returned without leaking signin URLs, no account takeover, but quota drain is possible.

### F4: CVE-2025-63389 Injectable (CRITICAL)

v0.21.2. All 10 models injectable via unauthenticated `/api/create`. A single request can overwrite the system prompt of any model on this GovCloud EC2 instance.

## Remediation

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
systemctl restart ollama
```

AWS Security Group: remove inbound rule allowing 0.0.0.0/0 on TCP 11434. Restrict to known IP ranges only.
