# Rasa Chatbot — Population Survey

**Date:** 2026-05-22
**Target:** Rasa Open Source conversational AI platform
**Mode:** Population survey. First Rasa-class survey.
**Corpus:** 196 IPs harvested via Playwright-driven Shodan web UI (API keys dead)
**Population estimate:** ~293 total (Shodan: 110 + 11 + 75 dork hits; corpus = 196 after dedup)

---

## 1. Summary

Rasa ships with no authentication on its REST webhook channel by default. The
`/webhooks/rest/webhook` POST endpoint accepts messages from any caller and returns
bot responses without requiring a token, cookie, or API key. This is a design
default, not a misconfiguration — Rasa's documentation requires operators to
explicitly configure a token to enable auth, and most do not.

196 IPs harvested from three Shodan dorks: `port:5005 http.html:"rasa"` (110),
`http.html:"/webhooks/rest/webhook"` (11), `http.title:"Rasa"` (75). After dedup,
196 unique IPs.

Webhook probe result: **98/196 (50%) confirmed open, 0/196 auth-gated**.

The 50% rate reflects mixed production/development deployments. The 0 auth-gated
result on any of 196 hosts confirms the auth-on-default thesis fails for this
platform class — Rasa inverts the default to no-auth, putting burden on operators
to opt in.

**Confirmed operator exposures (high-priority):**

| IP | Domain | Operator | Sector | Bot name |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 102.220.23.140 | odpc.go.ke | Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (Kenya) | Government | ODPC Virtual Assistant |
| 122.255.56.140 | leco.lk | Lanka Electricity Company (Sri Lanka) | Utility | LECO Smart Chat |
| 129.150.52.232 | hnbgeneral.com | HNB General Insurance (Sri Lanka) | Insurance | HNBGI Nexa |
| 34.34.173.215 | — | Uludağ Elektrik (Turkey) | Utility | KVKK consent flow |
| 5.78.124.207 | — | Unknown (Hetzner/DE) | Commercial | Payment validation |

## 2. Corpus Construction

Shodan API keys on `rooster` returned 401. Harvest executed via Playwright web UI
scraping: authenticated to shodan.io, used `fetch()` with browser credentials to
paginate each dork's results, saved raw IP lists to JSON.

Three dorks:

| Dork | Raw hits | IPs extracted |
|---|---|---|
| `port:5005 http.html:"rasa"` | ~110 pages | 110 |
| `http.html:"/webhooks/rest/webhook"` | ~11 pages | 11 |
| `http.title:"Rasa"` | ~75 pages | 75 |
| **After dedup** | | **196** |

Imported to `empire.db` via `jaxen import --no-lookup /tmp/rasa_corpus.txt`.

## 3. Identity Marker

Rasa's identity is confirmed by three conjuncts:

1. **Port 5005 listening** (Rasa default; many deployments use 80/443 via reverse proxy)
2. **GET `/` returns** `Hello from Rasa: X.Y.Z` (version string)
3. **POST `/webhooks/rest/webhook`** returns `[{"recipient_id":"<sender>","text":"..."}]` JSON

The version string (`Hello from Rasa: 3.5.10`) is the primary fingerprint — no
standard HTTP server, framework, or middleware emits this banner. Versions confirmed
in corpus: 2.8.0, 3.5.10, 3.6.20, 3.9.6.

The webhook response schema is the secondary marker: the `recipient_id` field echoes
the caller-supplied `sender` value, which no other platform does in this shape.

**Recommended aimap fingerprint (conjunctive):**

```
port: 5005
GET / → body contains "Hello from Rasa:"
POST /webhooks/rest/webhook → status 200, body is JSON array with recipient_id key
```

This is a zero-false-positive three-conjunct marker (Insight #6 discipline).

---

## 4. Verification Protocol

Read-only probe: `POST /webhooks/rest/webhook` with body `{"sender":"probe","message":"hello"}`.

- **200 + JSON array with `recipient_id`**: confirmed Rasa, no auth required
- **401/403**: auth-configured instance (rare in corpus; 0 seen)
- **404/non-Rasa response**: false positive from dork

Secondary probe: `GET /` — confirms version string.

Tertiary probe: `GET /status` — returns `{"model_file":"...","num_active_training_jobs":0}`.
Model file path discloses internal deployment naming conventions (e.g.,
`20260509-152631-convoluted-polo.tar.gz`). No auth required.

---

## 5. Findings

### 5.1 Rasa unauthenticated /webhooks/rest/webhook — population level

**98/196 (50%) confirmed open, 0 auth-gated.**

Any unauthenticated caller can:
- Inject arbitrary messages into any active bot conversation
- Receive bot responses (including operator brand names, personas, service logic)
- Enumerate bot capabilities by cycling through message variations
- Observe backend error messages (see 5.4)
- Map payment and user-data collection flows (see 5.5)

This is not a misconfiguration in the traditional sense — Rasa's no-auth default
is documented behavior. Operators must explicitly set `credentials.yml` with a
`rest:` token. Most do not.

**Severity: HIGH** (population-level unauthenticated API access to production bots)

### 5.2 ODPC Kenya (odpc.go.ke) — government data protection authority

Rasa 3.5.10 at `102.220.23.140:5005`. TLS cert SANs `*.odpc.go.ke`. Hosted on
Dialog Telekom (KE). Bot responds to probe: "Hi, am ODPC Virtual Assistant. I was
created just to answer your questions..."

The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner of Kenya enforces the Kenya Data
Protection Act 2019. The enforcement body for data protection law runs an
unauthenticated conversational AI endpoint. An adversary can inject arbitrary
messages, map bot flows, and observe how the bot handles data-subject queries —
all without authentication.

**Severity: HIGH**

### 5.3 LECO Sri Lanka (leco.lk) — electricity utility

Rasa 2.8.0 at `122.255.56.140:5005`. TLS cert SANs `*.leco.lk`. Hosted on Dialog
Axiata (LK). Bot: "LECO Smart Chat" — Lanka Electricity Company is Sri Lanka's
principal electricity distribution utility.

The bot handles customer service queries (billing, outage reports). Production
customer interaction surface exposed without auth.

**Severity: HIGH**

### 5.4 Backend DB error propagated to unauthenticated caller

Three IPs in the same /22 — `201.150.62.35`, `201.150.62.39`, `201.150.62.44` —
return on every probe:

```
ERROR Fetch User Name: Invalid environment value: None!
```

A backend database or environment-variable lookup failure leaks error text to any
unauthenticated caller. The stack cannot retrieve user context and propagates the
exception string in the Rasa response body. This discloses backend dependency
failure and internal function naming.

**Severity: MEDIUM** (error propagation, internal dependency leak)

### 5.5 Payment validation bot — unauthenticated receipt intake

`5.78.124.207:5005` (Hetzner, DE). Rasa 3.6.20. Bot: "Soy el asistente de
validación de pagos. Envíame el comprobante o los identificadores en el formato
correcto." Bot state on probe response: `WAITING_RECEIPT`.

An unauthenticated caller can submit payment receipts and observe validation logic.
An adversary can enumerate accepted receipt formats, probe for validation weaknesses,
and observe error paths — all without authentication.

**Severity: HIGH** (payment validation logic exposed to unauthenticated callers)

### 5.6 LLM system prompt leaked in Rasa response

`208.110.93.69:5005` (WholeSale Internet, US). Rasa response to "hello" probe:
```
#llmgreet_english|You are a friendly and helpful assistant. Your re[...]
```

The raw LLM system prompt — including the template key `#llmgreet_english` and the
system prompt text — appeared in the `text` field of the webhook response. This
means the Rasa action server passes the LLM prompt prefix directly to the response
channel without sanitization. Any unauthenticated caller reads the system prompt.

**Severity: HIGH** (system prompt disclosure; prompt injection attack surface)

---

## 6. Negative Space

- **Population survey incomplete.** Shodan API keys dead. Playwright-harvested corpus
  covers 3 dorks × ~75-110 results. Full Shodan page depth on each dork is unknown.
  The 293 estimate is a lower bound — `port:5005` alone likely returns more hits
  against other known Rasa banners.
- **recongraph returned 0 nodes** for ODPC and Uludağ Elektrik — no Shodan host
  record to seed from.
- **VisorSD blocked** — Shodan API 401; dork catalog documented but not executed.
- **VisorRAG blocked** — embedding API 401 (same infra gap as Sessions 30-31).
- **VisorAgent deferred** — ethical-stop; no local LLM on `rooster`.
- **LLM prompt leak host (208.110.93.69)** became unresponsive after initial probe.
  Finding confirmed on first response; host may have rate-limited or dropped.

## 7. Tool Gaps Identified

### 7.1 aimap — no Rasa fingerprint

aimap ran against 98 confirmed open hosts on ports 5005, 80, 443, 8080. Detected
0 AI services. The aimap fingerprint database has no Rasa entry — it does not
probe `GET /` for "Hello from Rasa:" or `POST /webhooks/rest/webhook` for the Rasa
response schema. Result: aimap is structurally blind to the entire Rasa platform class.

**Proposed fingerprint:** conjunctive — port 5005 (or configurable) + GET `/`
banner contains "Hello from Rasa:" + POST `/webhooks/rest/webhook` returns
`{"recipient_id":...}` JSON. Add as a service fingerprint entry in the aimap
fingerprint registry.

### 7.2 VisorBishop — no Rasa class

VisorBishop processed 98 URLs but exited without findings or JSON output. Rasa is
not in VisorBishop's platform classifier. Unauth probe against Rasa on port 5005
produces no severity output.

### 7.3 VisorScuba AI.C1 — second non-Ollama false positive

VisorScuba AI.C1 fired "Unauthenticated Ollama" on all 6 ingested Rasa findings.
None are Ollama. This is the second confirmed instance of the Session 31 tool gap
(Session 31 anchor: PromptLayer SPA edge). The defect generalizes: any finding
ingested with `authenticated:false` fires AI.C1 with hardcoded "Ollama" text.

This is a structural schema problem. The fix (proposed Session 31) remains: add
`finding_class` enum to the VisorScuba node schema, make AI.C1 template read from
it, add AI.C10 for `webhook_unauth` class findings.

## 9. Next Actions

1. **Restore Shodan access**, then run full dork suite: `jaxen hunt 'port:5005 http.html:"rasa"'`,
   `jaxen hunt 'http.html:"/webhooks/rest/webhook"'`, `jaxen hunt 'http.title:"Rasa"'` with
   pagination depth. Quote raw vs marker-confirmed counts (Insight #15).
2. **Add Rasa fingerprint to aimap** — GET `/` banner + POST /webhooks/rest/webhook schema
   conjunct (Section 3). This is a blocker: aimap is blind to the entire platform class.
3. **Add Rasa class to VisorBishop** — unauth webhook POST probe, severity HIGH.
4. **Fix VisorScuba AI.C1** — `finding_class` enum + non-Ollama message template + AI.C10
   `webhook_unauth` rule (Section 7.3, originally proposed S31).
5. **Candidate Insight** — "Rasa inverts the auth-on-default pattern: the platform ships
   no-auth, requiring opt-in. Population rate: 50% open, 0% auth-gated. The auth-on-default
   thesis does not hold for open-source chatbot frameworks that default to zero auth."
6. **Disclose ODPC Kenya** — government data protection authority; contact surface at
   odpc.go.ke. Operator decision by Nick.
