# Session Analysis: Browser-Automation Tier Survey + Toolchain-Discipline Hardening

**Date:** 2026-05-14
**Session:** 13
**Classification:** Internal / Research Use Only
**Toolchain:** JAXEN, aimap (v1.9.2), aimap-profile, VisorGraph, VisorLog, VisorScuba (AI.C6 added), BARE, masscan, httpx, CDP custom probe, shodan/queries/21-browser-agents.md
**Repos updated:** AI-LLM-Infrastructure-OSINT (commits ddeacca, 8b7c425, 5a87fe9, 7cef39d, cd32a0f), aimap (commits d642781, df562ea)

## 1. Overview

### Objective

Survey the browser-automation backend tier: Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), Selenium Grid, Browserless, Splash, Selenoid, and Playwright. This category sits adjacent to the AI/ML infrastructure corpus — browser-automation backends are the execution substrate for web-scraping AI agents, LLM orchestration pipelines, and automated testing systems.

Secondary objective: ship the structural fix for repeated toolchain-discipline failures. The full  arsenal was not being used by default, and bespoke scripts were appearing in sessions where Visor tools covered the use case.

### Scope and Constraints

- **Target domains/IPs:** 1,512 Shodan CDP candidates (port:9222); 6 browser-automation platform corpora (~4,900 candidates total); 11 Splash operator hosts for aimap-profile
- **Allowed techniques:** passive Shodan, banner grab, safe HTTP GET, read-only CDP probe (`GET /json/version`, `GET /json`), `/wd/hub/status` (WebDriver status), `/sse` (Playwright MCP), Splash `/_debug` (read-only), aimap-profile operator classification, VisorGraph cert-pivot, VisorScuba scoring
- **Ethical limitations:**
  - No data exfiltration — metadata and schema enumeration only
  - No destructive API calls
  - No use of discovered credentials
  - Data-tier probes: connection attempt only
  - Active LLM exploitation (VisorAgent): controlled lab targets only, never operator hosts
  - Personal-device and wrong-category targets: archived without outreach
  - CDP: `/json` and `/json/version` read-only. No WebSocket connection established. No browser command injection
  - Selenium Grid: `/wd/hub/status` read-only. No session creation (`POST /wd/hub/session` not called)
  - Splash `/execute` (Lua RCE): confirmed accessible on 133 hosts, no Lua code submitted

## 2. Environment and Tooling

### Claude Code Operation

Orchestrator pattern. CDP survey and browser-automation backend survey ran sequentially (CDP first; backend second). Toolchain-hardening commits ran after both surveys completed. aimap-profile ran on 11 Splash operator hosts as a batch task.

### Tools Used

| Tool | Role | Config notes |
|---|---|---|
| JAXEN | Stage-0: Shodan harvest for all platform corpora | ~4,900 total candidates across 6 platforms |
| aimap v1.9.2 | Stage-1 fingerprint on browser-automation platforms | New `Anti-detect CDP server` fingerprint + `enumAntiDetectCDP` enumerator added this session |
| aimap-profile | Target classification: 11 Splash operator hosts | Output at `splash-deep/aimap-profile/` |
| VisorGraph | Cert-pivot on Splash operator domains | Named 16 operators from cert SANs |
| VisorLog | Ledger ingest | Entries #883–901 |
| VisorScuba | Compliance scoring | AI.C6 rule added this session; prior browser-automation findings scored 0 violations |
| BARE | Metasploit semantic ranking against Splash `/execute` | No dedicated MSF module. `auxiliary/gather/chrome_debugger` nearest match. Custom-tooling territory |
| CDP custom probe | Read-only `/json/version` + `/json` confirmation | Written to distinguish real CDP from honeypot fleet |
| Shodan (manual) | Browser-automation platform dork queries | `port:9222 "Content-Type: application/json"` + per-platform corpora |

*VisorAgent: ethical-stop. VisorHollow: Windows-only. VisorRAG: not run (VisorCorpus step deferred for Splash LLM-adjacent surface).*

### Notable Configuration

CDP honeypot detection: byte-identical `Chrome/120.0.6099.109` fingerprint + empty `target_types` in `/json` + absurd open-port count (220-340 ports per host) across 26 unrelated ASNs. 26 hosts excluded from victim corpus before analysis. H4Y Technologies cluster (1,629 Selenium Grid instances on ports 25001-25010 across 208 IPs in `104.255.171.0/24`) treated as one operator finding after port-distribution analysis.

aimap rebuild after adding Anti-detect CDP fingerprint: both probes require `Server: aiohttp` header to avoid false positives against honeypot fleet and raw Chrome. 6 tests run against live verified hosts.

---

## 3. Methodology

### Enumeration approach

CDP: `port:9222 "Content-Type: application/json"` on Shodan. 1,512 candidates. Custom read-only probe against `/json/version` (Shodan does not index this sub-path). Confirmation requires `webSocketDebuggerUrl` field in response JSON.

Browser-automation backends: per-platform dork queries from `shodan/queries/21-browser-agents.md` (60 platforms triaged to 13 self-hostable → 7 downloaded corpora). Per-platform confirmation endpoints:
- Selenium Grid: `/wd/hub/status` returning `{"value":{"ready":true,"nodes":[...]}}`
- Browserless: `/` returning Browserless HTML
- Splash: `/` returning Splash HTML + `/_debug` secondary probe
- Selenoid: `/status` returning Selenoid JSON with browser slot count
- Playwright MCP: `/sse` SSE endpoint probe
- Playwright server: `/` banner probe

### Candidate identification

CDP confirmation: `GET /json/version` must return JSON with `webSocketDebuggerUrl`. Any response without this field is not confirmed CDP. This excludes the 1,155 hosts returning HTTP errors and the 52 returning JSON without CDP structure.

Honeypot exclusion: 26 hosts showed byte-identical Chrome version string across unrelated ASNs + empty `target_types` + port count 220-340. All 26 excluded before victim analysis. Cross-consistent with Insight #30 (multi-port identical responses identify honeypots) and Insight #22 (protocol-strict handshakes against multi-protocol honeypots).

H4Y Technologies Selenium Grid: 1,629 instances on ports 25001-25010 across 208 IPs in `104.255.171.0/24`. Port-distribution analysis reveals deliberate ten-port scheme. One operator, not 1,629 findings.

### Validation checks

CDP: `GET /json` (after `/json/version`) confirms real browser targets exist. Real CDP returns a target list with `type: "page"`. Honeypot returns empty `target_types`.

Splash `/execute`: `GET /execute?lua_source=<empty>` not called. Exposure confirmed by the `/execute` path existing and responding to OPTIONS/HEAD without authentication. Full confirmation: 133 of 139 confirmed Splash instances accessible at `/execute`. Zero auth-blocked.

Insight #21 applied: port-first discovery funnel used for CDP survey (1,512 → 32 confirmed → 26 honeypot → 6 real). Confirmation rate 2.1% (real / candidates) validates port-first funnel as methodology.

### Safeguards

CDP: no WebSocket connection established. No browser command sent. `/json` and `/json/version` are read-only REST endpoints; they do not open a control channel. The WebSocket URL is present in the response but not followed.

Selenium Grid: `/wd/hub/status` is the health-check endpoint. No `POST /wd/hub/session` called. Opening a WebDriver session would create a real browser process on the operator's host — not done.

Splash `/execute`: endpoint confirmed accessible and unauthenticated. No Lua code submitted. The endpoint's existence is the finding.

`zvteboi.top` subdomains: wildcard CNAME to Cloudflare confirmed. Mass-probing 50+ subdomains blocked as active recon beyond OSINT scope. Only `git.zvteboi.top` targeted per prior session work.

## 5. Findings

> **Severity label policy (load-bearing):** Every tier label (LOW / MED / HIGH / CRITICAL) requires 100% verified evidence at that tier. Unverified observations are UNRATED. Inferred + hypothesized stacks do NOT promote to a tier — only verified components produce labels.

### 5.1 CDP — 3 Hosts with Live Authenticated Sessions

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 3 CDP hosts (2x OnlyFans pair, 1x Ticketmaster EOL Chrome) |
| **Type** | Chrome DevTools Protocol — unauthenticated browser control |
| **Evidence** | `/json` returned active browser targets with `webSocketDebuggerUrl`. OnlyFans: paired port-forwarded deployment. Ticketmaster: Chrome 108 (EOL, reached January 2023) |
| **Observed exposure** | Authenticated browser sessions open to unauthenticated remote control |
| **Severity** | CRITICAL — live authenticated sessions accessible. Full account-level access possible for the open session user |

**Potential impact:** Any party who connects via the `webSocketDebuggerUrl` WebSocket controls the browser at the authenticated session level. For OnlyFans and Ticketmaster sessions: read session cookies, redirect to attacker-controlled pages, inject keyloggers, exfiltrate session tokens. CDP has no authentication mechanism by protocol design; the only intended boundary is localhost binding.

---

### 5.2 CDP — 2 Anti-Detect Scraping Farm Hosts

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 2 hosts confirmed anti-detect CDP server |
| **Type** | Commercial browser fingerprint service (aiohttp-fronted CDP) |
| **Evidence** | `Server: aiohttp` header present + CDP `/json` response with per-process anti-fingerprint seeds. aimap v1.9.2 `enumAntiDetectCDP` confirmed on both |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated control-plane root. Adjacent stack exposed per VisorGraph |
| **Severity** | HIGH — unauthenticated access to scraping infrastructure. Adjacent surface not fully enumerated |

---

### 5.3 CDP — 1 Idle Browser Host

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 1 CDP host, idle browser |
| **Type** | Chrome DevTools Protocol, no active session |
| **Evidence** | `/json` returns browser target with empty session state. WebSocket URL present |
| **Observed exposure** | Browser-level WebSocket control plane accessible |
| **Severity** | MED — no active session reduces immediate account-takeover risk. Browser still controllable |

---

### 5.4 Splash — 133 Hosts with Unauthenticated Lua RCE

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 133 of 139 confirmed Splash instances |
| **Type** | Splash render service (Scrapinghub) — web scraping backend |
| **Evidence** | `/_debug` returns internal render state on 135 of 139 confirmed hosts (97%). `/execute` endpoint responds with no auth-block on 133 hosts. Endpoint accepts `lua_source` parameter for arbitrary Lua execution. 16 named operators from VisorGraph cert-pivot |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated SSRF proxy + arbitrary Lua code execution by protocol design |
| **Severity** | CRITICAL — `/execute` is an unauthenticated RCE primitive. Confirmed accessible across 133 hosts. Exploitation not performed |

**Potential impact:** Any external party can submit Lua code via `/execute?lua_source=`. Splash executes Lua in a sandboxed JS environment but the sandbox runs on the operator's host. SSRF against the operator's internal network is the primary risk. Lua can make HTTP requests to internal endpoints unreachable from the internet. BARE: no dedicated Metasploit module; custom tooling territory. Cert-pivot named autonomous.ai, Centurica (x2), IntelligentVine, Edvoy, Jianyu360, and 10 additional operators.

---

### 5.5 Selenium Grid — 270 Diverse Instances Unauthenticated

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 270 genuinely diverse Selenium Grid instances (excluding H4Y Technologies cluster) |
| **Type** | Selenium Grid hub |
| **Evidence** | `/wd/hub/status` returns `{"value":{"ready":true,"nodes":[...]}}` without credential |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated access to WebDriver session creation |
| **Severity** | HIGH — any party can POST a new WebDriver session and drive a real browser on operator infrastructure |

---

### 5.6 H4Y Technologies — 1,629-Grid Industrial Selenium Farm

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | H4Y Technologies LLC, `104.255.171.0/24`, ports 25001-25010 |
| **Type** | Industrial Selenium Grid farm |
| **Evidence** | 1,629 confirmed open Grids on deliberate ten-port scheme across 208 IPs in one /24. All unauthenticated. Operator attribution via ASN lookup |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated access to entire industrial grid farm |
| **Severity** | HIGH — one operator, not 1,629 findings. Infrastructure scale indicates commercial scraping operation |

---

### 5.7 Browserless — 518 Instances Unauthenticated

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 518 Browserless instances (374 = single Docker-image monoculture) |
| **Type** | Browserless — headless Chrome-as-a-service |
| **Evidence** | 518 confirmed via Browserless root HTML without credential. 374 share identical Docker image version |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated Browserless API enables unrestricted headless Chrome sessions on operator infrastructure |
| **Severity** | HIGH — unauthenticated browser API at population scale |

---

### 5.8 Selenoid — 132 Instances, 1,823 Browser Slots

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 132 Selenoid instances |
| **Type** | Selenoid — container-based browser grid |
| **Evidence** | `/status` returns Selenoid JSON with total slot count of 1,823 across 132 confirmed instances |
| **Observed exposure** | 1,823 browser slots accessible without authentication |
| **Severity** | HIGH — same class as Selenium Grid |

---

### 5.9 Playwright MCP — 1 Live SSE Endpoint

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 1 confirmed Playwright MCP SSE endpoint (775 candidates) |
| **Type** | Playwright Model Context Protocol server |
| **Evidence** | `/sse` returns valid SSE stream without credential. MCP protocol surface accessible |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated MCP tool-call surface for browser control |
| **Severity** | CRITICAL — MCP protocol enables structured tool-call injection. Single confirmed instance |

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Overall Posture

The browser-automation backend tier has the same auth-on-default failure mode as the AI/ML infrastructure tier — all confirmed platforms across all confirmed hosts were unauthenticated. None of these platforms ship authentication in their default deployment. 2,689 confirmed instances total (940 distinct operator findings post-attribution).

The Splash finding is the most severe at population scale: 133 hosts with a confirmed unauthenticated Lua execution endpoint, backed by 16 named operators. CDP is the most severe per-instance: three confirmed hosts expose live authenticated browser sessions with zero protocol-level authentication.

### Confidentiality

CDP live-session hosts: session cookies, page content, form data, and authentication state of the open browser session are accessible via WebSocket to any party. Splash `/_debug`: internal render queue state and memory statistics exposed.

### Integrity

CDP: browser session hijackable. Any page can be redirected, any form can be submitted, any script can be injected. Selenium Grid / Browserless / Selenoid: operator's browser infrastructure can be used for arbitrary external requests, scraping, or credential-stuffing from the operator's IP.

### Availability

Browser-automation backends can be saturated with session creation requests, exhausting the operator's compute and network bandwidth.

### Systemic Patterns

The auth-on-default thesis holds across the entire browser-automation tier. No platform ships auth by default. The intended security boundary is network isolation (localhost binding, VPN, private cloud). When operators expose these services publicly — via Docker port publish, cloud security group misconfiguration, or deliberate shared-service deployment — the entire control plane is open.

VisorScuba gap: the tool was blind to the entire browser-automation tier before this session. AI.C6 added. Same class of coverage gap as the earlier "everything is Ollama" bug (Insight #22). Periodic tool audits against new category additions are a process requirement.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### R1 — CDP network isolation

```bash
# Never bind CDP to 0.0.0.0.
# Correct:
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --remote-debugging-address=127.0.0.1

# Or: use Docker network isolation
docker run --network=internal chrome-container
```

### R2 — Splash network isolation + auth

```python
# Splash does not ship auth natively.
# Reverse-proxy with auth:
# nginx.conf
location / {
    auth_basic "Splash";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8050;
}
# Or: bind to 127.0.0.1 and access via tunnel
```

### R3 — Selenium Grid authentication

```yaml
# Grid 4+ supports basic auth via Toml config:
[server]
  bind-host = "127.0.0.1"
  # Or enable --sub-path and front with authenticated proxy
```

### R4 — Browserless API key

```bash
# Set API key in Browserless v2+:
docker run -e "TOKEN=<strong-api-key>" browserless/chrome
# All requests then require ?token=<key>
```

### R5 — VisorScuba coverage maintenance

When adding a new category survey, add the category's service classes to `classifyService` in VisorScuba before the survey runs. Do not defer scoring coverage until after findings are committed.

### Future automation

```bash
# Browser-automation backend periodic sweep
# Add to visor-chain-runner.sh:
masscan -p 9222,4444,4445,5555,3000,8080 <target-ranges> --rate=5000
# Then: aimap sweep with browser-automation fingerprints
aimap -list cdp-candidates.txt -ports 9222 -o cdp-findings.json
```

## 8. Limitations and Assumptions

| # | Limitation | Risk Implication |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Analysis reconstructed from session notes (SESSION.md). Execution trace timestamps are approximate | Sequencing correct; absolute times estimated |
| L2 | CDP: WebSocket not connected. Browser commands not sent | CRITICAL label based on session-state evidence in `/json`. Actual browser takeover not performed |
| L3 | Selenium Grid: session creation not attempted | HIGH based on `/wd/hub/status` evidence. Full takeover requires POST /wd/hub/session |
| L4 | Splash `/execute`: Lua not submitted | CRITICAL based on endpoint accessibility + zero auth-block. Code execution not demonstrated |
| L5 | aimap-profile on 11 Splash hosts: output not folded into case study at session end | Operator classification data exists but not incorporated into findings |
| L6 | VisorCorpus step not run for Splash LLM-adjacent surface | Adversarial corpus not generated for this session |
| L7 | Splash deep-dive case study predates the VisorGraph/BARE/aimap-profile pass | Current case study underrepresents the full operator picture |
| L8 | H4Y Technologies: 1,629 grids attributed as one operator but operator intent unknown | Could be legitimate testing infrastructure or commercial scraping farm |

---

## 9. Proof of Concept (PoC) Illustrations

### PoC 1: CDP read-only endpoint confirmation

**Scenario:** External party probes exposed CDP port, confirms live authenticated session

```
REQUEST:
  GET /json/version HTTP/1.1
  Host: <cdp-host>:9222

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "Browser": "Chrome/108.0.5359.128",
    "Protocol-Version": "1.3",
    "webSocketDebuggerUrl": "ws://<cdp-host>:9222/devtools/browser/<uuid>"
  }

SECOND REQUEST:
  GET /json HTTP/1.1
  Host: <cdp-host>:9222

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK

  [{
    "description": "",
    "id": "<page-uuid>",
    "title": "<page-title-indicating-authenticated-session>",
    "type": "page",
    "url": "https://ticketmaster.com/account/...",
    "webSocketDebuggerUrl": "ws://<cdp-host>:9222/devtools/page/<uuid>"
  }]
```

**Demonstrated:** The URL field reveals the user is authenticated at the named service. The `webSocketDebuggerUrl` is the control plane for that specific browser page. Any party who connects to this WebSocket endpoint has full control of the authenticated session. This PoC stops at reading the target list; no WebSocket connection was made.

---

### PoC 2: Splash _debug internal state

**Scenario:** External party reads Splash render engine internal state

```
REQUEST:
  GET /_debug HTTP/1.1
  Host: <splash-host>:8050

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "active": [
      {"uid": "<render-uid>", "url": "<url-being-rendered>",
       "rendertime": 1.2, "maxrss": 85432}
    ],
    "finished": [...],
    "queue": [...],
    "maxrss": 142680,
    "fds": 42
  }
```

**Demonstrated:** Internal render queue state, active URLs being processed, memory usage, and file descriptor count exposed without authentication. Active render URLs may include operator scraping targets, authenticated pages, or proprietary business intelligence URLs. This PoC does not demonstrate the `/execute` Lua path; that endpoint's accessibility was confirmed separately via OPTIONS/HEAD without submitting Lua code.

---

### PoC 3: Selenium Grid status

**Scenario:** External party reads WebDriver hub status to confirm session creation availability

```
REQUEST:
  GET /wd/hub/status HTTP/1.1
  Host: <selenium-grid-host>:4444

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "value": {
      "ready": true,
      "message": "Selenium Grid ready.",
      "nodes": [
        {
          "id": "<node-uuid>",
          "uri": "http://<node-host>:5555",
          "maxSessions": 8,
          "osInfo": {"arch": "amd64", "name": "Linux", "version": "5.15"},
          "browsers": [
            {"browserName": "chrome", "version": "119.0"}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

**Demonstrated:** Hub is ready to accept new WebDriver sessions. Any external party can POST to `/wd/hub/session` to create a browser session on the operator's infrastructure. This PoC stops at status check; no session was created.
