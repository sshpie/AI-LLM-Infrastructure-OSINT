**Date:** 2026-05-21
**Session:** 28
**Classification:** Internal / Research Use Only
**Toolchain:** masscan · embed-probe.py · aimap v1.9.22 (batch) · JAXEN (import mode) · TOME · VisorPlus · VisorGraph · aimap-profile · VisorLog · BARE · VisorCorpus · VisorScuba
**Repos updated:** AI-LLM-Infrastructure-OSINT (314ecc1 survey commit + TOME platform additions)

## 1. Overview

### Objective

First run of Category 27 — Embedding Services. Target class: text-embedding inference endpoints (Hugging Face Text Embeddings Inference / TEI, infinity-embedding, custom FastAPI wrappers). Thesis question: are embedding API services exposed on tier-2 cloud IP ranges without authentication? Secondary: integrate TOME into the survey chain and expand its corpus with two new platform patterns.

Also surfaced a new structural pattern: OVMS backend co-location (Candidate Insight #50) — when a custom FastAPI embedding wrapper is exposed, its Intel OpenVINO Model Server backend is also frequently exposed on a co-located port.

### Scope and Constraints

- **Target IP ranges:** Tier-2 cloud (Scaleway/OVH/Hetzner/DigitalOcean) — 3.5M IPs approximated
- **Target ports:** 7997 (infinity-embedding default), 8000, 8001, 8002, 8080, 3000
- **Allowed techniques:** masscan port scan, HTTP GET probe, Shodan host API, aimap service fingerprint
- **Ethical limitations:**
  - No data exfiltration — metadata and schema enumeration only
  - No destructive API calls
  - No use of discovered credentials
  - Data-tier probes: connection attempt only (no vector queries issued beyond single test)
  - VisorAgent: controlled lab targets only, never operator hosts
  - Personal-device and wrong-category targets: archived without outreach

## 2. Environment and Tooling

### Claude Code Operation

Single-session orchestrator. aimap batch dispatched in background (6,273 IPs × 39 ports, 50 threads) — running at session end. embed-probe.py and masscan ran sequentially in foreground. Single confirmed host (46.4.204.44) received full arsenal run.

### Tools Used

| Tool | Role | Config notes |
|---|---|---|
| JAXEN | Masscan data import → empire.db | `--no-lookup` flag (Shodan search credits exhausted both keys) |
| masscan | Tier-2 cloud port sweep | 6,544 open-port hits; ports 7997/8000/8001/8002/8080/3000 |
| embed-probe.py | HTTP probe against masscan hosts | 0/6,526 confirmed; stale hits + HTTP-only |
| aimap v1.9.22 | Service fingerprint on 6,273 unique IPs | 50 threads; batch submitted, still running at session end |
| TOME | Platform corpus passive scan | 17 platforms; 0 confidence on 46.4.204.44 — embedding-api + OVMS not in corpus |
| VisorPlus | Host enrichment | Hetzner AS24940, GreyNoise clean, 1 hostname (default Hetzner) |
| VisorGraph | Cert-pivot | HTTP-only on both ports; no TLS cert; no pivot surface |
| aimap-profile | Target classification | `unclassified`; bare VPS; research or personal deployment |
| VisorLog | Ledger ingest | 1 host ingested; 37 total .db nodes post-run |
| BARE | Metasploit semantic ranking | Port 8001: no specific embedding module (closest: 0.448). Port 9000: OVMS analogy match via Ollama RCE module (0.369) |
| VisorCorpus | Adversarial corpus generation | 26KB corpus built (kb_exfiltration, system_prompt, config_secrets) |
| VisorScuba | Compliance scoring | 37 nodes assessed post-ingest |
| VisorSD | [—] | Shodan credits exhausted |
| VisorGoose | [—] | Not applicable — no Ollama target |
| menlohunt | [—] | Not applicable — Hetzner host, not GCP |
| recongraph | [—] | No domain pivot chains on bare VPS |
| nu-recon | [—] | No Shodan API available |
| cortex | [—] | No auth-context ambiguity |
| JS-bundle | [—] | No SPA surface on embedding API |
| VisorRAG | [ethical-stop] | Controlled targets only |
| VisorAgent | [ethical-stop] | Controlled targets only |
| VisorHollow | [—] | Windows-only |

### Notable Configuration

- Shodan search credits exhausted (both API keys, monthly reset). JAXEN ran in `import --no-lookup` mode: masscan data ingested to empire.db without Shodan enrichment.
- masscan scan of ~3.5M tier-2 IPs across 6 ports. Hetzner `46.4.0.0/16` was NOT in tier2-ranges.txt at session start — the only confirmed host was found via Shodan host API, not the masscan sweep. Logged as fix item.
- embed-probe.py is HTTP-only. HTTPS embedding services not reachable. Logged as fix item.
- aimap batch submitted at session end — 6,273 IPs × 39 ports, 50 threads. Results pending for Session 29.

## 3. Methodology

### Enumeration Approach

Tier-2 cloud IP range sweep via masscan → per-host HTTP probe (embed-probe.py) → fingerprint confirmed hosts (aimap) → full arsenal on any confirmed embedding service. Parallel: Shodan host API lookup for known-pattern IPs (46.4.204.44 found this way).

### Candidate Identification

Embedding service fingerprint: root GET returns JSON with `embedding_dimension`, `model_name`, `backend` fields. BAAI/bge-m3 model confirmation via `/openapi.json` and `POST /embed` response shape. OVMS confirmed via `GET /v1/config` returning model version status JSON.

### Validation Checks

- `/` → JSON with `embedding_dimension` field → FastAPI wrapper confirmed (Insight #6: conjunctive match required)
- `/openapi.json` → API schema → endpoint inventory
- `POST /embed {"text":"test"}` → 1024-float vector → live inference confirmed (single test probe; no repeated extraction)
- Port 9000: `GET /v1/config` → `{"bge-m3":{"model_version_status":[...]}}` → OVMS confirmed

### Safeguards

Single test vector issued to `/embed` to confirm live inference (1024-float response). No batch extraction, no repeated probing, no use of `/embed/batch` for volume extraction. OVMS backend: `GET /v1/config` and `/v1/models/{name}/metadata` only — no inference via raw TF Serving predict API. No SSH access attempted.

## 5. Findings

> **Severity label policy:** Every tier label requires 100% verified evidence at that tier.

### 5.1 46.4.204.44 — Custom FastAPI Embedding API, Unauthenticated (MED)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Host** | 46.4.204.44:8001 (Hetzner DE, AS24940) |
| **Type** | Custom FastAPI embedding wrapper (uvicorn) |
| **Evidence** | `GET /` → `{"status":"healthy","model_loaded":true,"model_name":"BAAI/bge-m3","embedding_dimension":1024,"backend":"openvino-int8-throughput"}`. `POST /embed {"text":"test"}` → 1024-float vector. CORS: `*`. Auth: none. |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated embedding extraction, unlimited per rate (no rate limiting observed). Any origin can POST and receive BAAI/bge-m3 embeddings. |
| **Severity** | MED — confirmed unauth API; no PII/credential access; compute abuse is the primary risk |

**Potential impact:** Adversary can extract embeddings for arbitrary text at Hetzner bandwidth cost to the operator. No attribution on the operator side — requests appear as normal inference traffic. Model architecture fully disclosed (INT8 quantization level, OpenVINO backend, 1024-dim BERT-family structure).

### 5.2 46.4.204.44:9000 — OpenVINO Model Server Backend, Directly Exposed (MED, Insight #50)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Host** | 46.4.204.44:9000 |
| **Type** | Intel OpenVINO Model Server 2026.0.0 (inference backend) |
| **Evidence** | `GET /v1/config` → `{"bge-m3":{"model_version_status":[{"version":"1","state":"AVAILABLE"}]}}`. `GET /v2/` → `{"name":"OpenVINO Model Server","version":"2026.0.0.4d3933c5c"}`. |
| **Observed exposure** | Backend exposed directly alongside FastAPI wrapper. TF Serving SignatureDef accessible at `/v1/models/bge-m3/metadata`. Exact git commit hash in version string. |
| **Severity** | MED — backend bypass possible with tokenized input; version-exact fingerprint enables CVE matching |

**Potential impact:** Adversary with tokenized inputs can bypass the FastAPI wrapper's input validation and invoke the backend inference engine directly. Exact version string (including git commit hash) narrows CVE matching to a specific build.

### 5.3 Shodan-Dark Problem — Embedding Tier Invisible at Population Scale (OBSERVED)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Finding** | Embedding services are not indexed by Shodan at any useful depth |
| **Evidence** | 0/6,526 masscan hits confirmed as embedding services. Port-7997 hits were stale. Bare JSON responses not indexed by Shodan HTML crawler. |
| **Observed** | Population-scale discovery of embedding services requires active masscan + HTTPS-capable probe — passive Shodan approach does not work for this class |

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Overall Posture

Single confirmed host at this stage. The primary finding is structural (Shodan-dark problem) rather than a large vulnerable population. The embedding tier is invisible to standard Shodan-based discovery methods; active scanning is required. The confirmed host demonstrates the class exists at this tier but does not indicate a large exposed population.

### Confidentiality

No PII or credential access on the confirmed host. Model architecture, embedding dimensions, and backend runtime disclosed without auth. Embeddings themselves are vector representations — reversibility is academically studied but not a direct practical risk on a BAAI/bge-m3 general-purpose model.

### Integrity

No write-tier operations. No model-modification surface observed.

### Availability

Unauth embedding API with no rate limiting. Adversary could submit high-volume batch requests (`POST /embed/batch`) to exhaust Hetzner bandwidth or cause service degradation. No impact verification performed (restraint).

### Systemic Patterns

- OVMS co-location (Insight #50): when a FastAPI embedding wrapper is deployed, the OVMS backend on port 9000 is also exposed. Ports 8001 and 9000 require separate firewall rules; operators who firewall 8001 may leave 9000 open.
- The Shodan-dark problem is specific to embedding services: they return bare JSON (`{"embedding": [...]}`) that Shodan's HTML crawler skips. This makes the class systematically underrepresented in any Shodan-based survey.
- Hetzner `46.4.0.0/16` not in tier2-ranges.txt was a coverage gap that hid the confirmed host from the masscan sweep.

## 7. Recommendations

### R1 — 46.4.204.44: Add Authentication

```python
# FastAPI authentication middleware:
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException
from fastapi.security import APIKeyHeader

api_key_header = APIKeyHeader(name="X-API-Key")

async def verify_api_key(api_key: str = Depends(api_key_header)):
    if api_key != VALID_API_KEY:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403)
```

### R2 — Firewall OVMS Backend Port

```bash
ufw deny 9000
# OVMS should only be reachable from the FastAPI wrapper (localhost or docker network)
```

### R3 — Add Hetzner Range to Survey

```bash
echo "46.4.0.0/16" >> ~/AI-LLM-Infrastructure-OSINT/data/tier2-ranges.txt
```

### R4 — Add HTTPS Support to embed-probe.py

Current implementation is HTTP-only. TLS embedding services are not reachable. Estimated miss rate unknown but likely significant given HTTPS adoption trends.

### Future Automation

```bash
# Embedding service discovery when Shodan credits reset:
jaxen dork 'http.html:"embedding_dimension"' --download --limit 500
jaxen dork 'http.html:"Infinity Emb"' --download --limit 500
jaxen dork 'http.html:"model_pipeline_tag"' --download --limit 500
# Then: aimap batch on downloaded IPs
```

---

## 8. Limitations and Assumptions

| # | Limitation | Risk Implication |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Shodan search credits exhausted; JAXEN ran import-only | Discovery dorks not executed; population size for embedding tier unknown via Shodan |
| L2 | embed-probe.py is HTTP-only | HTTPS embedding services not reached; confirmed host count understates true population |
| L3 | Hetzner 46.4.0.0/16 absent from tier2-ranges.txt | Primary confirmed host missed by masscan; found via Shodan host API only |
| L4 | aimap batch still running at session end | Full tier-2 cloud fingerprint results deferred to Session 29 |
| L5 | Single confirmed embedding service host | Insight #50 (OVMS co-location) is a candidate; additional confirmations needed for numbered status |
| L6 | Analysis reconstructed from session notes (SESSION.md). Execution trace timestamps are approximate. | |

## 9. Proof of Concept (PoC) Illustrations

### PoC 1: Unauthenticated Embedding Extraction

**Scenario:** External actor extracts text embeddings using the operator's deployed model without credentials.

```
REQUEST:
  POST /embed HTTP/1.1
  Host: 46.4.204.44:8001
  Content-Type: application/json

  {"text": "test input"}

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {"embedding": [0.0123, -0.0456, 0.0789, ... (1024 floats total)]}
```

**Demonstrated:** Any caller receives a full 1024-dimensional BAAI/bge-m3 embedding without authentication. CORS `*` means any origin is permitted. What this does NOT do: extract multiple embeddings, use the batch endpoint for volume extraction, or interact with any stored data.

### PoC 2: OVMS Backend Version and Architecture Disclosure

**Scenario:** Researcher identifies OVMS backend exposure via port 9000 enumeration after finding the FastAPI wrapper on port 8001.

```
REQUEST:
  GET /v2/ HTTP/1.1
  Host: 46.4.204.44:9000

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {"name":"OpenVINO Model Server","version":"2026.0.0.4d3933c5c"}

REQUEST:
  GET /v1/models/bge-m3/metadata HTTP/1.1
  Host: 46.4.204.44:9000

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK

  {TF Serving SignatureDef with input tensor shapes:
   input_ids: DT_INT64 [-1, -1]
   attention_mask: DT_INT64 [-1, -1]
   token_type_ids: DT_INT64 [-1, -1]}
```

**Demonstrated:** Exact version string including git commit hash (2026.0.0.4d3933c5c) disclosed. Full input tensor architecture revealed. Model family inferred (BERT-class: 3 input tensor types, DT_INT64). Backend exposed alongside FastAPI wrapper — both unauthenticated on separate ports.
