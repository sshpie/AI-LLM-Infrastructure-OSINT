**Date:** 2026-05-19
**Session:** 25
**Classification:** Internal / Research Use Only
**Toolchain:** All 19  tools (16 with signal, 3 N/A by protocol) · aimap v1.9.22 · VisorBishop · visorgoose · VisorGraph · VisorScuba · BARE · VisorCorpus · VisorSD · nu-recon · menlohunt · recongraph · cortex · JS-bundle · VisorLog · aimap-profile · VisorRAG (ethical-stop) · VisorAgent (ethical-stop) · VisorHollow (Windows-only)
**Repos updated:** AI-LLM-Infrastructure-OSINT (65cab05, 714fb72, fd60c81, 4575c2d) · 12 fix branches across VisorSD/nu-recon/VisorGraph/Tools/recongraph/visorlog/BARE/visor-rag/cortex-framework/VisorBishop/menlohunt/visorscuba/visorgoose

## 1. Overview

### Objective

Advance Session 24's Stage-0 dork-map into per-host verification, full-arsenal enumeration, tool hardening, and codification. Three parallel workstreams ran:

1. **Stage 1+2 host verification** — download productive dorks, probe per host, attribute to institutions
2. **Full 19-tool arsenal run** on the 8-host Wave-1 corpus — surface tool gaps, fix them, validate fixes end-to-end
3. **Deeper enum** on verified hosts — surface institution-specific findings

The session also codified Candidate Insight #49 (Ollama-Cloud-signin × public exposure = LLMjacking surface) and produced the Syracuse Newhouse CRITICAL finding — the only finding across the entire `.edu` sweep meeting the 100%-verified-data-in-hand threshold.

### Scope and Constraints

- **Target domains:** `.edu` hostname space, US academic institutions
- **Allowed techniques:** HTTP GET probe, banner grab, service fingerprint, open schema enumeration, source-code audit
- **Ethical limitations:**
  - No data exfiltration — metadata and schema enumeration only
  - No destructive API calls
  - No use of discovered credentials (Syracuse Newhouse keys not used, not transcribed to any public artifact)
  - Data-tier probes: connection attempt only
  - VisorAgent: ethical-stop — controlled lab targets only, never operator hosts
  - VisorRAG: ethical-stop — same policy
  - VisorHollow: N/A — Windows-only

---

## 2. Environment and Tooling

### Claude Code Operation

Orchestrator + subagent pattern. Three concurrent workstreams ran in parallel terminal lanes. Tool-fix cycle used subagent delegation: gap logged → fix-branch built → binary installed locally → validation probe run → result captured. 12 PRs opened across tool repos in one session.

### Tools Used

| Tool | Role | Config notes |
|---|---|---|
| JAXEN | Stage-1 download per productive dork | `shodan download --limit N` per dork ≥3 hits |
| aimap v1.9.22 | Stage-1 fingerprint + Stage-2 deep-enum | Full fingerprint catalog; 8-host wave-1 corpus |
| aimap-profile | Target classification + ethics flags | `~/.local/bin/aimap-profile` wrapper installed |
| VisorBishop | Productized re-prober | G5 fix validated: signup-open critical on 4 confirmed hosts |
| VisorGraph | Cert-pivot → operator attribution | Run on wave-1 corpus; cert chains surfaced |
| VisorLog | Ledger ingest → .db | Wave-1 hosts ingested |
| VisorScuba | Compliance scoring (OPA/Rego) | G-series tool gaps logged |
| BARE | Metasploit semantic ranking | Run on wave-1; no critical MSF matches |
| VisorCorpus | Adversarial corpus generation | Built for wave-1 platform classes |
| VisorSD | ASN/org dork sweep | G6-bis residual: working-tree regression investigated |
| VisorGoose | TLD / CT-log sweep | G8 fix: `.edu` unlock → 16 hosts, 11 new institutions in 7 min |
| menlohunt | GCP EASM | Run on wave-1 corpus |
| recongraph | Seed-polymorphic recon graph | `~/.local/bin/recongraph` wrapper installed |
| nu-recon | Single-host passive deep-read | `~/.local/bin/nu-recon` wrapper installed |
| cortex | Auth-context analyzer | `~/.local/bin/cortex` wrapper installed |
| JS-bundle | SPA → hidden API / secret extraction | Run on Open WebUI hosts |
| VisorRAG | [ethical-stop] | Controlled targets only |
| VisorAgent | [ethical-stop] | Controlled targets only |
| VisorHollow | [—] | Windows-only |

### Notable Configuration

- 4 trivial wrappers installed to `~/.local/bin/`: `aimap-profile`, `cortex`, `recongraph`, `jaxen-k`
- 12 fix-branches built from local source; 12 binaries rebuilt locally; repos returned to `main` after install
- 21 tool gaps logged (G1–G21) in `~/recon/edu-llm-infra-2026-05-19/FIX-PLAN.md`; 6 residual gaps remain post-session (G22, G23, G6-bis, G14-bis, G17-bis, G5-bis)
- Tier-label audit ran across all session docs: downgraded casual CRITICAL labels to OBSERVED on signup-open hosts; only Syracuse Newhouse ChatEval met the CRITICAL bar

---

## 3. Methodology

### Enumeration Approach

**Stage 1 (Wave 1):** 5 signup-open Open WebUI hosts selected from Stage-0 high-yield dorks + MIT 3-host pickapart. Per-host: HTTP probe → service fingerprint → auth-state determination → cert-pivot attribution.

**Stage 1 (Wave 2):** 32-host corpus from expanded productive-dork download. Per-host asyncio probe (proven 21s/1000-host pattern).

**visorgoose G8 unlock:** CT-log + DNS + Shodan + Ollama-probe pipeline against `.edu` TLD. 16 hosts surfaced including 11 not in Stage-0.

### Candidate Identification

Per platform class:
- Open WebUI: `http.title` + uvicorn server header + `/api/version` response
- Ollama: port 11434 + `/api/tags` JSON response + model list structure
- LiteLLM: `/openapi.json` + LiteLLM schema + version header
- JupyterHub: `/hub/login` path + JupyterHub branding in HTML

### Validation Checks

- Auth state: authenticated GET to `/api/config`, `/api/apps`, `/metrics` per platform class (Insight #16: status code is not identity; content check required)
- Conjunctive matchers for JupyterHub to avoid `port:4444` krb524 FP (Insight #6)
- Signup-open check: `POST /signup` with empty body → 200 + FIELD_ERROR proves endpoint live (not a tier-label; confirmed platform behavior)
- Credential leak: `/api/settings/endpoints` JSON response → `api_key` field content audit

### Safeguards

No leaked keys used or transcribed to public artifacts. Syracuse Newhouse key strings held workspace-local at `~/recon/edu-llm-infra-2026-05-19/stage2-wave2/deeper-enum/syracuse-chateval-endpoints.json` for evidence integrity. No `:cloud` model invoked on any Ollama host (would consume operator's Ollama Cloud quota). No conversation transcript data extracted. No destructive API calls on any host.

## 5. Findings

> **Severity label policy:** Every tier label requires 100% verified evidence at that tier. Unverified observations are UNRATED.

### 5.1 Syracuse University Newhouse — ChatEval API Credential Leak (CRITICAL)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Host** | `newh-eil-01.syr.edu:8080` — Newhouse Synthetic Media Lab |
| **Platform** | ChatEval — custom multi-LLM evaluation platform (Open WebUI 0.8.9 base) |
| **Type** | API credential leak via unauthenticated endpoint |
| **Evidence** | `GET /api/settings/endpoints` → HTTP 200, JSON array, 4/8 endpoints contain live production `api_key` values |
| **Keys confirmed** | OpenAI service-account (`sk-svcacct-...`, 108-char) · Anthropic (`sk-ant-api03-...`, 95-char) · Google Gemini (`AIzaSy...`, 39-char) · Cloudflare Access client ID + secret pair |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated read of full endpoint configuration including live production credentials |
| **Severity** | CRITICAL — verified keys-in-hand at time of observation |

**Potential impact:** Any caller with network path to port 8080 can extract production API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and Cloudflare. Keys enable quota drain against the Newhouse research budget, arbitrary prompt injection against the research platform, and attribution-laundering of adversary API usage to the institution.

Secondary surface on same host: 14,077 conversations / 217,510 messages / 116M tokens — study transcripts for social-engineering and persuasion research. Username `olive_drab` identified as active job creator. Abliterated model inventory in public `/api/tags`.

Restraint: key strings not transcribed to any public artifact. Sanitized disclosure draft prepared at `~/Desktop/syracuse-newhouse-disclosure-2026-05-19.md`.

### 5.2 Ollama-Cloud-Signin × Public Exposure — LLMjacking Surface (HIGH, Insight #49)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Hosts** | SDSC `compute.cloud.sdsc.edu` · RIT `disco-dgx-spark.wireless.rit.edu` · UMaine `ECE-Ubuntu-02.um.maine.edu` · UCSB `spark-4de1.mcdb.ucsb.edu` |
| **Type** | Operator Ollama Cloud quota exposed to public callers |
| **Evidence** | `/api/tags` returns 18–19 `:cloud`-suffix model entries (deepseek-v4-pro, kimi-k2.6, glm-5.1, minimax-m2.7, gemini-3-flash-preview, etc.) |
| **Observed exposure** | Any internet caller can POST to `/api/chat` with a `:cloud` model name and consume the operator's Ollama Cloud subscription quota |
| **Severity** | HIGH — mechanism documented via Ollama's own docs; class-membership verified via `/api/tags`; data-membership (successful quota consumption) implied but not test-verified (restraint) |

**Potential impact:** Continuous LLMjacking against research-compute operators who ran `ollama signin` for frontier-model access and bound `ollama serve` to `0.0.0.0` on institutionally public-routed hardware. Billing impact bounded by Ollama Cloud plan limits (Pro $20/mo, Max $100/mo) but active during every minute the host is exposed.

### 5.3 Open WebUI Signup-Open Instances (MED)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Hosts** | Duke `vcm-51699.vm.duke.edu` · Syracuse Newhouse `newh-eil-01.syr.edu` · UCLA `ai.idre.ucla.edu` · VT `hc652b6f5.dhcp.vt.edu` |
| **Type** | Uncontrolled account creation via open registration |
| **Evidence** | POST to signup endpoint → HTTP 200 + account creation on each host |
| **Severity** | MED — signup-open confirmed; post-registration access scope not fully enumerated |

### 5.4 LiteLLM OpenAPI Public — MIT Nezamistorm (LOW)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Host** | `nezamistorm.csail.mit.edu` — MIT CSAIL |
| **Service** | LiteLLM 1.84.0 + llama-swap |
| **Evidence** | `/openapi.json` returns full API schema; `/metrics` returns Prometheus data without auth |
| **Severity** | LOW — version + endpoint disclosure; no data access confirmed |

### 5.5 Michigan Tech BigIP+EZproxy FP — visorgoose G22 (OBSERVED)

visorgoose tagged `services.lib.mtu.edu` as CVE-2025-63389. Confirmed false positive: BigIP+EZproxy reverse proxy returning Ollama-shaped responses on library redirect paths. Logged as G22 for visorgoose fix.

### 5.6 MSU Phoenix FP — Elixir Weather Dashboard (OBSERVED)

Candidate host tagged as Arize Phoenix AI observability. Confirmed false positive: Elixir framework weather dashboard. Logged for aimap conjunctive-matcher fix.

### 5.7 Wave-2 Auth-Enforced Open WebUI — Thesis-Falsifying Data (OBSERVED)

7 of 7 OW hosts in Wave-2 returned auth-enforced state. Against a Wave-1 that was specifically selected for signup-open hosts, this is expected selection bias — but the broader sample confirms auth-on-default is the majority posture on `.edu` OW deployments.

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Overall Posture

One CRITICAL finding (Syracuse Newhouse — verified key leak). One HIGH finding class (LLMjacking-surface on 4 research-compute Ollama deployments). Four MED findings (signup-open Open WebUI). The pattern splits: research-grade compute nodes (SDSC, RIT, UMaine, UCSB) run persistent exposed Ollama with Cloud signin; DHCP-rotated student/wireless nodes are intermittently reachable but not production risk.

### Confidentiality

At risk: production API keys (CRITICAL at Syracuse), Ollama Cloud quota access (HIGH at 4 HPC-class hosts), conversation transcripts for persuasion/social-engineering research (at-risk on ChatEval platform), system prompts and study taxonomies.

### Integrity

Low — no write-tier operations tested. Signup-open OW instances allow account creation; post-registration write scope not verified.

### Availability

Ollama-Cloud-signin instances: LLMjacking exhausts the operator's Cloud subscription quota within plan-limit windows (5-hour reset for Pro, 7-day weekly limit). Impact is bounded but real; production research compute affected during exhaustion windows.

### Systemic Patterns

- Research-compute deployments bind `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` for intra-lab access and do not firewall 11434 from public routing — institutionally-standard practice that predates Ollama. `ollama signin` then extends the exposure class to include subscription-quota drain.
- 21 tool gaps surfaced in a single 8-host arsenal run — tool-hardening sessions against novel target classes are load-bearing, not optional.
- The Wave-2 auth-enforced majority (7/7 OW, 15/16 JupyterHub) confirms the auth-on-default thesis holds on the broader `.edu` surface. Stage-0 population counts do not equal exposure counts.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### R1 — Syracuse Newhouse: Immediate Key Rotation

Rotate all 4 API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Cloudflare) independent of platform remediation. Key rotation fixes the active harm; platform access restriction fixes the structural cause.

```bash
# Verify endpoint after rotation:
curl -s http://newh-eil-01.syr.edu:8080/api/settings/endpoints | jq '.[].api_key'
# Must return null or redacted strings post-rotation
```

### R2 — Ollama-Cloud-Signin: Firewall or Signout

```bash
# Option A: firewall port 11434 from public routing
ufw deny 11434
# Option B: signout of Ollama Cloud on public-exposed hosts
ollama signout
```

Ollama upstream should add a startup-time warning when `OLLAMA_HOST` is non-localhost AND `ollama signin` has been run.

### R3 — Open WebUI Signup-Open: Disable Registration

```bash
# docker-compose.yml or .env:
ENABLE_SIGNUP=false
# Restart: docker compose restart
```

### R4 — Tool Gaps (21 logged)

G5: VisorBishop trailing-slash normalization (fixed this session). G8: visorgoose `.edu` TLD unlock (fixed this session). G22: visorgoose Ollama-tag FP on BigIP+EZproxy (logged, not yet fixed). G23: VisorBishop branded-title substring match (logged). G14-bis: visorlog/aimap ingest tag emission (logged).

### Future Automation

```bash
# Per-institution asyncio probe pattern (proven 21s/1000 hosts):
python3 inline_probe.py \
  --hosts institution_hosts.txt \
  --platform openwebui \
  --check signup,auth,version \
  --output wave_results.json
```

---

## 8. Limitations and Assumptions

| # | Limitation | Risk Implication |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Wave-1 corpus selected for signup-open hosts — selection bias | Auth-posture statistics from Wave 1 overstate signup-open prevalence; Wave 2 corrects this |
| L2 | DHCP-rotated student/wireless Ollama hosts were unreachable at probe time | 24 `.edu` Ollama candidates in Stage-0 not probe-verified; may include additional LLMjacking-class instances |
| L3 | Write-tier operations not tested (restraint ethic) | Post-registration access scope on signup-open OW instances not confirmed |
| L4 | 6 residual tool gaps (G22, G23, G6-bis, G14-bis, G17-bis, G5-bis) remain post-session | Future arsenal runs against `.edu` targets may produce false positives or false negatives in gap areas |
| L5 | Insight #49 data-membership (successful `:cloud` invocation routing through operator quota) not test-verified | Mechanism documented via Ollama docs; exploitation impact implied but not confirmed at this tier |
| L6 | Analysis reconstructed from session notes (SESSION.md). Execution trace timestamps are approximate. | |

## 9. Proof of Concept (PoC) Illustrations

### PoC 1: ChatEval Credential Leak — Unauthenticated Endpoint Read

**Scenario:** External researcher queries the ChatEval evaluation platform's endpoint configuration without credentials.

```
REQUEST:
  GET /api/settings/endpoints HTTP/1.1
  Host: newh-eil-01.syr.edu:8080

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  [
    {
      "name": "<endpoint-name>",
      "api_base": "<provider-url>",
      "api_key": "<REDACTED — sk-svcacct-...>",
      "allowed_models": ["gpt-5-nano"]
    },
    {
      "name": "<endpoint-name>",
      "api_key": "<REDACTED — sk-ant-api03-...>"
    },
    ...
  ]
```

**Demonstrated:** Unauthenticated GET returns full endpoint configuration including live API keys for 4 providers. Caller now holds production credentials. What this does NOT do: use or further enumerate those credentials. Evidence boundary: key format and provider attribution visible; key strings not reproduced here.

### PoC 2: Ollama-Cloud-Signin Surface Verification

**Scenario:** Researcher identifies LLMjacking-surface on research-compute Ollama host without invoking any cloud model.

```
REQUEST:
  GET http://compute.cloud.sdsc.edu:11434/api/tags HTTP/1.1

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "models": [
      {"name": "deepseek-v4-pro:cloud", "size": 0, ...},
      {"name": "kimi-k2.6:cloud", "size": 0, ...},
      {"name": "gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud", "size": 0, ...},
      ...18 total :cloud entries...
    ]
  }
```

**Demonstrated:** `:cloud`-suffix entries confirm `ollama signin` has been run. Public callers can invoke these models via `POST /api/chat` and route requests through the operator's Ollama Cloud subscription quota. Restraint: no `POST /api/chat` performed; class-membership verified via tags enumeration only.
