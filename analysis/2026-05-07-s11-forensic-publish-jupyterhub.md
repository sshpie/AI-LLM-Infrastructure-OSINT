# Session Analysis: Forensic Evidence Publish + JupyterHub Sweep + Disclosure Batch

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Session:** 11
**Classification:** Internal / Research Use Only
**Toolchain:** JAXEN, aimap, aimap-profile, -contact, VisorLog, Gmail API, subfinder, VirusTotal API, MalwareBazaar API
**Repos updated:** AI-LLM-Infrastructure-OSINT (commits 8ca03d2–3f9d6f7)

---

## 1. Overview

### Objective

Three objectives: (1) publish forensic evidence from the Ulm/Tencent active-compromise to public malware databases to establish a provenance record; (2) run the full JupyterHub academic-TLD sweep; (3) close the disclosure backlog with a bulk send. Secondary deliverable: structural refactor of the methodology insight catalog into per-permalink files.

### Scope and Constraints

- **Target domains/IPs:** JupyterHub instances on academic TLDs (.edu, .ac.uk, .edu.au, others); Eonix C2 host `173.232.146.173` / `zknotes.com`; Uirusu/2.0 and Hilix binary artifacts from session 10
- **Allowed techniques:** passive Shodan, banner grab, safe HTTP GET, VirusTotal/MalwareBazaar public submission (binary hashes only), JAXEN harvest, aimap fingerprint, aimap-profile classification, -contact WHOIS resolution
- **Ethical limitations:**
  - No data exfiltration — metadata and schema enumeration only
  - No destructive API calls
  - No use of discovered credentials
  - Data-tier probes: connection attempt only
  - Active LLM exploitation (VisorAgent): controlled lab targets only, never operator hosts
  - Personal-device and wrong-category targets: archived without outreach

## 2. Environment and Tooling

### Claude Code Operation

Orchestrator pattern with two parallel tracks: forensic publishing and JupyterHub sweep. Disclosure send pipeline executed sequentially against the 83-item backlog to avoid Gmail API rate limits.

### Tools Used

| Tool | Role | Config notes |
|---|---|---|
| VirusTotal API | Forensic submission: Hilix.x86_64 + Uirusu/2.0 | First public submission of both samples. SHA256 manifest built |
| MalwareBazaar API | Forensic submission | Reporter: ``. `dropped_by_sha256` relationship graph established |
| OTS (OpenTimestamps) | SHA256 manifest timestamp | Establishes provenance record for both binaries |
| JAXEN | Stage-0: JupyterHub academic TLD harvest | `jaxen import --no-lookup` on Shodan export |
| aimap | Stage-1 fingerprint on JupyterHub candidates | JupyterHub fingerprint |
| aimap-profile | Target classification + ethics flags | Academic institution classification |
| -contact | Disclosure recipient resolution | WHOIS SOA-RNAME + institutional security contact lookup |
| VisorLog | Ledger ingest | .db |
| Gmail API | Bulk disclosure send pipeline | `disclosures/send_drafts_api.py`,  |

*VisorAgent: ethical-stop. VisorHollow: Windows-only binary. VisorGraph not run this session (deferred to session 12).*

### Notable Configuration

83 disclosure emails queued. Gmail API pipeline rate-limited to stay within daily send quota. `_sent.json` used as authoritative send-state record (not frontmatter, which was stale). Em-dash removal pass ran across all 82 disclosure .md files to eliminate AI-tell signatures before send.

---

## 3. Methodology

### Enumeration approach

JupyterHub: Shodan export on `http.title:"JupyterHub"` filtered to academic TLDs. JAXEN imported results into `empire.db`. aimap ran fingerprint pass on the harvested IPs.

Forensic publishing: SHA256 of both binaries (Hilix.x86_64, Uirusu/2.0) submitted to VirusTotal and MalwareBazaar. No binary upload from operator hosts — hashes derived from session-10 evidence preservation.

### Candidate identification

JupyterHub candidates: `http.title:"JupyterHub"` on `.edu` / `.ac.uk` / `.edu.au` TLDs. Filtered honeypots using AS63949 block list. aimap-profile classified each confirmed host by institution type and flagged HIPAA/FERPA risk where applicable.

### Validation checks

JupyterHub: `GET /hub/login` returning 200 with JupyterHub HTML confirmed live instance. Auth state checked via `/hub/api` — 403 = auth enforced, 200 = open. Insight #6 applied: conjunctive matchers required; `http.title` alone insufficient.

Eonix C2 attribution: `173.232.146.173` resolved to `zknotes.com`. Disclosure drafted requesting C2 takedown.

### Safeguards

No data exfiltrated from JupyterHub instances. Forensic binary submissions used hash-only paths; no interaction with live hosts beyond read-only HTTP probes. Em-dash removal was a content-hygiene pass, not a probe. Disclosure pipeline used Gmail API in send-only mode; no inbox reads.

## 5. Findings

> **Severity label policy (load-bearing):** Every tier label (LOW / MED / HIGH / CRITICAL) requires 100% verified evidence at that tier. Unverified observations are UNRATED. Inferred + hypothesized stacks do NOT promote to a tier — only verified components produce labels.

### 5.1 Hilix.x86_64 + Uirusu/2.0 — First Public Submission

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | Hilix.x86_64 (miner payload), Uirusu/2.0 (IoT botnet) |
| **Type** | Malware artifacts from session-10 active compromise |
| **Evidence** | SHA256 manifest with OTS timestamp. VirusTotal first-submission confirmed. MalwareBazaar reporter: . Dropped-by relationship established |
| **Observed exposure** | Multi-actor targeting same Jupyter:8888 exposure class. Two independent campaigns, one victim host (Ulm CL1) |
| **Severity** | OBSERVED — publication artifact, not a new exposure |

**Potential impact:** Public IOC record established. C2 attribution to Eonix (`173.232.146.173` / `zknotes.com`) enables takedown requests.

---

### 5.2 Eonix C2 — `173.232.146.173` / `zknotes.com`

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | `173.232.146.173` / `zknotes.com`, AS-EONIX |
| **Type** | C2 infrastructure (reverse shell target for Hilix campaign) |
| **Evidence** | Reverse shell connection from Ulm CL1 (`134.60.110.66`) to `173.232.146.173:3053` observed during session 10. Attribution via session-10 forensic artifact |
| **Observed exposure** | Active C2 accepting reverse shells from compromised hosts |
| **Severity** | HIGH — confirmed C2 for active campaign. Disclosure requesting takedown sent |

---

### 5.3 JupyterHub Institutional Sweep — 6 Disclosures

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 6 academic hosts across .edu / .ac.uk / .edu.au TLDs |
| **Type** | JupyterHub instances, academic/research compute |
| **Evidence** | aimap fingerprint confirmed JupyterHub on each. aimap-profile classified institution type. Auth state probed via `/hub/api` |
| **Observed exposure** | Varies per host. Auth state confirmed for each before disclosure routing |
| **Severity** | MED (auth enforced but version-disclosed) to HIGH (auth gap confirmed) — per-host evidence required |

**Potential impact:** Research data and compute resources. FERPA-relevant user data in JupyterHub session tokens at academic institutions.

---

### 5.4 Ollama Claude Desktop Bridge — Threat Model Expansion

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | `ollama launch claude-desktop` subcommand (v0.23.1) |
| **Type** | Vendor feature expanding existing unauth-Ollama threat model |
| **Evidence** | Primary-source review of `cmd/launch/claude_desktop.go`. Writer sets `inferenceProvider`, gateway URL, API key, and auth scheme. Claude Desktop subsequently routes model calls through the operator's Ollama instance |
| **Observed exposure** | Existing unauth Ollama exposure now carries model-routing pivot risk: any Ollama model can be presented as Claude to the desktop client |
| **Severity** | OBSERVED — threat model expansion of prior HIGH findings |

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Overall Posture

Session 11 is primarily consolidation: forensic record publication, disclosure send, and structural methodology improvements. No new exploitable surfaces identified beyond the Eonix C2 attribution and the Ollama threat-model expansion.

### Confidentiality

JupyterHub institutional sweep: research data, student data, and compute credentials at risk for hosts with auth gaps. Specific hosts handled via per-disclosure evidence.

### Integrity

Eonix C2 takedown request addresses active campaign. If not actioned, the C2 infrastructure continues enabling Hilix campaign propagation.

### Availability

No availability-impacting findings in this session.

### Systemic Patterns

Em-dash removal highlights a publishing-hygiene issue that applies to all prior artifacts. AI-tell signatures (em dashes, two-beat reveals, meta-confessions) were present in 82 disclosure documents. Structural fix: 3-pass removal committed. Prevents downstream detection of AI authorship by recipient security teams.

Insight #11: source code as authority over bug reports. Three prior cases where framing was wrong until primary source verified (Ulm CL1 vendor vs. operator; SUNY Buffalo routing; Ollama Claude Desktop config writer). Now codified as discipline.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### R1 — JupyterHub auth default

```python
# jupyterhub_config.py
# Require authentication; no token-disabled deployments
c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = 'jupyterhub.auth.PAMAuthenticator'
c.Authenticator.allowed_users = {'research-team-member-1', 'research-team-member-2'}
# Bind to localhost if external access is not required
c.JupyterHub.bind_url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000'
```

### R2 — C2 takedown

Contact Eonix abuse channel with IOC package: `173.232.146.173`, `zknotes.com`, port 3053. Include SHA256 of dropped payloads and OTS timestamp for provenance.

### R3 — Disclosure publishing hygiene

All published artifacts should pass an AI-tell check before send. Em dashes (`—`) are the primary signal. Use `grep -r ' — ' disclosures/` to catch regressions.

### Future automation

```bash
# Periodic JupyterHub academic sweep
bash ~/AI-LLM-Infrastructure-OSINT/data/visor-chain-runner.sh jupyterhub-edu
```

## 8. Limitations and Assumptions

| # | Limitation | Risk Implication |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Analysis reconstructed from session notes (SESSION.md). Execution trace timestamps are approximate | Sequencing is correct; absolute times are estimates |
| L2 | `_sent.json` authoritative, frontmatter stale for 75 of 83 disclosures entering this session | Prior-session send status may have been misread in interim |
| L3 | 8 disclosures remained unsent at session end (cleared session 12) | Small backlog carried forward |
| L4 | JupyterHub auth states: per-host, not reported in aggregate | Aggregate count (6 disclosures) masks individual severity variation |
| L5 | VirusTotal detection rates not recorded | IOC utility dependent on vendor adoption post-submission |
| L6 | Eonix C2 takedown response pending at session close | Campaign may continue until Eonix acts |

---

## 9. Proof of Concept (PoC) Illustrations

### PoC 1: JupyterHub auth-state probe

**Scenario:** Read-only probe of JupyterHub API to determine auth enforcement

```
REQUEST:
  GET /hub/api HTTP/1.1
  Host: <academic-institution-host>

RESPONSE (auth gap):
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {"version": "x.x.x"}

RESPONSE (auth enforced):
  HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
  Content-Type: application/json

  {"status": 403, "message": "Forbidden"}
```

**Demonstrated:** A single unauthenticated GET distinguishes open from closed JupyterHub instances. The `200` case exposes version and indicates the hub API is accessible without session. This PoC stops at version enumeration. No sessions created, no user data accessed.

---

### PoC 2: Ollama Claude Desktop threat model

**Scenario:** Claude Desktop configured to route via unauth Ollama

```
REQUEST (by Claude Desktop):
  POST /api/chat HTTP/1.1
  Host: <unauth-ollama-host>:11434
  Content-Type: application/json

  {"model": "claude-3-opus", "messages": [...]}

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK

  {"model": "claude-3-opus", "message": {"role": "assistant",
   "content": "<response from operator-loaded model>"}}
```

**Demonstrated:** The Claude Desktop client trusts the gateway URL written by `ollama launch claude-desktop`. Any model loaded on the unauth Ollama can impersonate the requested model name. Existing unauth-Ollama findings (HIGH) now carry model-routing misrepresentation as a secondary risk.
