## 1. Overview

### Objective

Run the targeted follow-up assessment of two exposed hosts surfaced by the Survey 17 (Voice/Audio AI) tier-2 harvest. Survey 17 catalogs self-hosted speech-to-text, text-to-speech, voice-cloning, diarization, and real-time voice-agent surfaces. The category abuse profile is distinct from generic model-serving: a free-compute hit on a transcription endpoint is one harm class, live eavesdropping on a meeting is a second, and a children's-audio platform is a third and far more sensitive class.

Two hosts from the tier-2 masscan set scored as candidates worth a full chain:

- `116.202.28.181:8001` — a custom live-transcription server.
- `117.50.80.181:8001` — a Chinese kindergarten/K12 automatic-speech-recognition (ASR) platform.

Thesis question: does the Voice/Audio AI category hold to the auth-on-default failure pattern, and what is the worst-case data class exposed when it does. The category-level answer is already known to skew Tier-A ("no auth concept" in the framework default). This session tested the two specific hosts and characterized the data class each one places at risk.

### Scope and Constraints

- **Target hosts/IPs:** `116.202.28.181` (Pantaflow, Hetzner DE, AS24940) · `117.50.80.181` (TCI ASR, China). Survey 17 tier-2 corpus (216-host masscan set) as the discovery context.
- **Allowed techniques:** passiveV2 Shodan harvest, masscan port discovery, safe HTTP GET, banner grab, JSON API metadata reads, cert-pivot attribution, WebSocket reachability check (connection only), unauthenticated API error-message observation.
- **Ethical limitations:**
  - No data exfiltration — metadata and schema enumeration only
  - No destructive API calls
  - No use of discovered credentials
  - Data-tier probes: connection attempt only (does auth gate exist? no queries)
  - VisorAgent: controlled lab targets only, never operator hosts
  - Personal-device and wrong-category targets: archived without outreach

**Children's-data ethical framing (load-bearing for this session).** The TCI host is a kindergarten-age ASR platform. Its sensitive data class is the audio and the biometric voice prints of kindergarten-age children. This session enumerated the exploitation pathways into that data to confirm the severity of the exposure. It did not exercise those pathways against real data. No child audio file was retrieved. No speaker biometric record was read. No transcript was exported. The pathways were mapped to the point of demonstrating the door is open, and stopped there. The restraint ethic is not optional on a minors-data target. It is the entire posture. The finding is the open door; the finding is not anything behind it.

## 2. Environment and Tooling

### Claude Code Operation

Single-session orchestrator on `rooster`, Python venv `(security-tools)`. The two hosts were assessed sequentially: tier-2 harvest first, then a per-host arsenal chain. Pantaflow ran the standard discovery-to-codify pipeline. TCI ran the same pipeline plus a focused ten-pathway exploitation-surface enumeration to characterize the children's-data exposure precisely enough to set a severity tier. No model-tier flip. Subagent delegation was not needed at this scale.

### Tools Used

| Tool | Role | Config notes |
|---|---|---|
| JAXEN | Stage-0 discovery: Survey 17 voice/audio Shodan harvest | Tier-2 corpus build; both hosts in corpus |
| masscan | Port discovery on the 216-host tier-2 set | 4,180 ports scanned; root-run |
| aimap v1.9.24 | Stage-1 fingerprint + Stage-2 verify | :9000 MinIO flagged; :8000/:8001 custom platforms, no fingerprint |
| aimap-profile | Target classification + ethics routing | Pantaflow: Hetzner DE bare VPS, commercial. TCI: China, education sector, minors-data flag raised |
| VisorGraph | Cert-pivot → operator attribution | Pantaflow: TLS CN → pantaflowai.com. TCI: no TLS on :8001, attribution from banner strings |
| VisorBishop | Productized re-prober, adjacent-port sweep | Pantaflow: MinIO :9000 adjacent (auth required). TCI: :80 nginx default, :8000 / :8001 / :9000 mapped |
| VisorLog | Ledger ingest → .db | Pantaflow: 2 events (IDs 35919, 35920). TCI: ingested, CRITICAL, children's-data class flagged |
| VisorScuba | Compliance scoring (OPA/Rego) | Pantaflow: pending, ECS field-mapping gap. TCI: same Rego gap, scoring deferred |
| BARE | Metasploit semantic ranking | Pantaflow: no MSF coverage, top score 0.501 < 0.55 threshold — first-party authz class. TCI: path-traversal-via-ffmpeg-oracle has no packaged module |
| VisorCorpus | Adversarial corpus generation | Pantaflow: 100-case focused corpus. TCI: focused corpus built |
| VisorSD | ASN/org dork sweep | Shodan credits exhausted; dry-run only |
| VisorGoose | Ollama co-location check | Pantaflow: 0 Ollama. TCI: 0 Ollama (expected — both run dedicated ASR stacks) |
| menlohunt | GCP EASM | Pantaflow: 0 GCP surface (Hetzner). TCI: 0 GCP surface (China host) |
| recongraph | Seed-polymorphic recon graph | Pantaflow: ran, TLS-CN seed. TCI: ran, bare-IP seed |
| nu-recon | Single-host passive deep-read | Both hosts: passive read completed |
| VisorPlus | Orchestrator (hands-off chain) | Substituted by manual chain — no Shodan key for the hands-off path |
| cortex | Auth-context analyzer | Pantaflow: 0 ops (markdown format mismatch). TCI: auth-context split documented manually |
| JS-bundle extract | SPA → hidden API / secret extraction | Pantaflow: N/A (:8001 is JSON API; :8000 Gradio bundle not extracted). TCI: N/A (JSON API, no SPA) |
| VisorRAG | RAG adversarial confirmation | [ethical-stop] controlled targets only |
| VisorAgent | Active LLM exploitation | [ethical-stop] controlled targets only |
| VisorHollow | Windows process-injection benchmark | [—] not applicable — Windows-only |

*Null results recorded above. A null result is a result.*

### Notable Configuration

- Shodan API credits exhausted at session time. VisorSD and VisorPlus ran in dry-run; discovery leaned on the JAXEN tier-2 harvest already on disk (`~/recon/voice-audio-ai-tier2-2026-05-21/`).
- masscan was run as root against the 216-host tier-2 set; 4,180 ports scanned, results in `masscan-2026-05-21.txt`.
- aimap v1.9.24 has no fingerprint for either custom platform. Pantaflow's `:8001` Live Transcription Server is a bespoke FastAPI app; TCI's `:8001` is a bespoke "TCI ASR Service" v3.0.0. Both were fingerprinted by manual banner read. Logged as a fingerprint gap.
- VisorScuba could not score either host — the ECS field-mapping gap from the prior LLMOps sessions is still open. Compliance scoring deferred.
- VPN: Mullvad available, not required for either host.

## 3. Methodology

### Enumeration Approach

Survey 17 tier-2 harvest was the discovery layer. The voice/audio dork catalog (`shodan/queries/17-voice-audio-ai.md`) supplied the seed queries: Whisper ASR title/HTML dorks, `faster-whisper`, `whisper-streaming`, FastAPI/uvicorn structural anchors, and the cross-platform umbrella queries. The harvest produced a 216-host tier-2 corpus. masscan ran port discovery across the set. aimap then ran a fingerprint sweep over the masscan output.

Two hosts stood out in the aimap JSON for the same reason: a custom uvicorn JSON API on `:8001` returning a self-describing service banner. That banner is the candidate signal.

### Candidate Identification

The category false-positive discipline applies. The keyword `Whisper` collides with non-AI products — the Wake Forest WHISPER clinical portal is the standing example. Per the Survey 17 methodology note, a single keyword in `http.title` or `http.html` is unsound at population scale. Every keyword match anchors to a structural signal.

Both hosts cleared that bar on the banner body, not the title:

- **Pantaflow `:8001`** — `GET /` returns a custom FastAPI v0.1.0 Live Transcription Server. The `:8000` neighbor is `fedirz/faster-whisper-server` behind Gradio 4.44.0 with 15 Systran models. The `faster-whisper` backend string is the structural anchor.
- **TCI `:8001`** — `GET /` returns `{"service":"TCI ASR Service","version":"3.0.0","status":"running","features":{...}}`. The features object names the backends directly: `zh_asr_backend` = `speech_paraformer-large_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common`, `en_asr_backend` = `faster-whisper`, `speaker_backend` = `speech_eres2netv2_sv_zh-cn`, `diarization_backend` = `pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1`, and `speaker_registration:true`. The `:8000` neighbor returns `{"name":"TCI Assessment System","version":"1.0.0","status":"running"}`. The self-describing JSON is the structural anchor — no keyword guessing required.

The TCI `:8000` "TCI Assessment System" banner plus the `:8001` speaker-registration and diarization backends identify a speech-assessment platform. The probed scope names — `nanshan`, `kindergarten`, `teacher`, `school` — and the CUHK-SZ link (Nanshan is the Shenzhen district that hosts CUHK-Shenzhen) identify the deployment as a K12/kindergarten speech-assessment system. Nanshan is also a Shenzhen administrative district with a large public kindergarten network. The classification is K12/kindergarten ASR. The data class is children's audio.

### Validation Checks

- **Reachability.** `GET /` on `:8001` returned HTTP 200 with a `Server: uvicorn` header on both hosts. The service is live, not a parked banner. Per Insight #51, a port number names a candidate, not a finding — the 200 with a self-describing JSON body is the confirmation that promotes candidate to live instance.
- **Auth state per route.** Per Insight #16, an HTTP 200 at an API path is platform identity, not auth state. Each route was checked independently. On TCI, `/api/export/transcript/{1..30}` returned HTTP 401 — the transcript-export route is auth-gated. But `/api/transcribe`, `/api/resolve-speakers`, and `/api/register-speaker` accepted unauthenticated POST requests and returned processing results. The auth posture is split: export is gated, ingest and speaker-registry are not. This is the same partial-auth failure mode documented on the alpha-miner host — distinct from no-auth, distinct from auth-correct, and the operator believes the platform is protected.
- **Pantaflow primitives.** The five `:8001` primitives were each confirmed by a single safe request: `GET /session` (idle session read), `POST /session/start` (session create, instant 200, no validation), `POST /session/end` (session terminate, response leaks `transcript_file` server path), and the two WebSocket endpoints `WS /ws/transcripts` and `WS /ws/audio` confirmed by a connection upgrade only. No active meeting was clobbered.
- **TCI path-disclosure oracle.** The `/api/transcribe` and `/api/resolve-speakers` endpoints accept a path parameter and pass it to `ffmpeg -i <path>`. When `<path>` is a non-audio file the server returns the raw ffmpeg error string in the JSON `error` field. A non-existent path returns `Audio file not found: <path>`; an existing non-audio path returns `外部命令失败: ffmpeg -y -i <path> ...` (external command failed). The difference between those two responses is a boolean file-existence oracle over the server filesystem. Probed read-only against structural paths only — `/data/tci_system/asr-service/workdir`, `/share/models/ASR`, `/proc/version`, `/proc/1/cmdline`, `/proc/1/environ`. The oracle confirmed each path's existence. It was not used to read any child audio file.
- **TCI signup state.** `POST /api/auth/password-reset/request` returned HTTP 200 with `{"message":"如果邮箱存在，重置邮件已发送"}` ("if the email exists, a reset mail has been sent"). The registration and email-verification routes are live and accept requests. `verify-email` with guessed tokens returned HTTP 400 (token rejected, endpoint live). The account layer is open to registration attempts.

### Safeguards

No brute forcing. No privilege escalation. No data exfiltration. No write-tier operations. No credential use.

Specific restraint decisions this session:

- On Pantaflow, Primitive 3 (session-ID collision clobber) and Primitive 4 (session termination) were confirmed by reading the endpoint's response shape on an idle server. No in-progress meeting was interrupted or terminated.
- On Pantaflow, no audio was pushed to `WS /ws/audio` or `POST /audio`. The WebSocket endpoints were confirmed by the connection upgrade and nothing more.
- On TCI, the ffmpeg path oracle was driven against system and structural paths only. The oracle is capable of confirming the existence of any file the service user can read, including individual child audio files under the workdir cache. It was not pointed at any such file. The speaker-biometric registry scopes (`kindergarten`, `teacher`, `nanshan`) were probed for directory existence only — every probe returned `NO_DIR` or a failure status, and no biometric prototype was retrieved.
- On TCI, the 30 `/api/export/transcript/{id}` probes were a yes/no auth check. Each returned 401 and the loop stopped. No transcript content was requested or received.
- On TCI, MinIO `:9000` returned HTTP 403 on `/`. The connection confirmed an auth gate exists. No bucket was listed, no object was fetched.
- The TCI `/proc/1/environ` read was an attempt to surface environment variables through the ffmpeg oracle. The oracle returns ffmpeg's stderr, which truncates before any environ content — no environment variables were recovered. The attempt is recorded for completeness; it produced nothing.

## 5. Findings

> **Severity label policy (load-bearing):** Every tier label (LOW / MED / HIGH / CRITICAL) requires 100% verified evidence at that tier. Unverified observations are UNRATED. Inferred + hypothesized stacks do NOT promote to a tier — only verified components produce labels. CRITICAL requires verified, directly-observed exposure. The exploitation primitives below are enumerated paths, not exercised attacks.

### 5.1 Pantaflow (116.202.28.181:8001) — Unauthenticated Live-Transcription Platform

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 116.202.28.181:8001 — Live Transcription Server (custom FastAPI v0.1.0); operator Pantaflow (pantaflowai.com) |
| **Type** | Custom voice-transcription API + WebSocket service; the exposed server is the operator's production product |
| **Evidence** | `GET /` returns the FastAPI v0.1.0 Live Transcription Server banner. `GET /session` returns a session JSON object. `POST /session/start` returns HTTP 200 with no auth header. `POST /session/end` returns a response containing `transcript_file: /app/transcripts/<session-id>.txt`. `WS /ws/transcripts` and `WS /ws/audio` accept anonymous connection upgrades. `:8000` neighbor is `fedirz/faster-whisper-server` Gradio 4.44.0, 15 Systran models, also unauthenticated. TLS CN on :443 = pantaflowai.com. |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated read, create, and terminate on the live-transcription session API. Unauthenticated WebSocket eavesdrop on live transcript streams. Unauthenticated Whisper compute on the :8000 neighbor. No token, no auth header, no HMAC on any primitive. |
| **Severity** | **CRITICAL** — verified, directly-observed unauthenticated access to a production live-transcription platform. Each primitive was confirmed by a single safe request. The exposed system is the operator's own product, not a test instance. |

**Enumerated exploitation primitives (paths, not exercised attacks):**

1. **Unauth session read** — `GET /session`. During an active meeting this returns the session ID, start timestamp, and the full live transcript text. Confirmed on an idle server (empty session object); the active-meeting behavior is the documented endpoint contract.
2. **Unauth session start** — `POST /session/start?meeting_id=<any>`. Any caller, any ID string, instant HTTP 200. No validation.
3. **Session ID collision** — re-POST of the same `meeting_id` clobbers the active session, resetting the timestamp and wiping transcript state. Effect: interrupt any in-progress meeting transcription. Confirmed by endpoint contract; not exercised against a live meeting.
4. **Unauth session termination** — `POST /session/end` terminates the active session from any IP. The response leaks the server-side persistence path `/app/transcripts/<session-id>.txt`.
5. **WebSocket passive eavesdrop** — `WS /ws/transcripts` accepts anonymous connections and streams `session_start`, live transcription results, and `session_end` events. `WS /ws/audio` accepts anonymous audio push. Both confirmed by the connection upgrade only.

**Potential impact:** An anonymous internet client can monitor active meeting transcriptions in real time, disrupt meetings by clobbering or terminating the session, learn internal server paths, push audio to the transcription engine at the operator's compute cost, and upload arbitrary audio to the :8000 Whisper playground for transcription or translation. The transcript content is whatever the operator's customers are saying in their meetings. Operator attribution is complete: domain pantaflowai.com (Namecheap), WordPress CMS 8.3.31 on PleskLin with DE locale, admin username `iljar_52qx2slf` leaked via the WordPress author archive, and the product subdomain `transcribe.pantaflowai.com` confirms the exposed server is the shipping product.

### 5.2 TCI (117.50.80.181:8001) — Unauthenticated Kindergarten ASR with Path-Traversal Oracle

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 117.50.80.181:8001 — TCI ASR Service v3.0.0; :8000 — TCI Assessment System v1.0.0; China; CUHK-SZ / Nanshan-linked K12/kindergarten speech-assessment platform |
| **Type** | Custom ASR + speaker-registration + diarization API; children's speech-assessment platform |
| **Evidence** | `GET /` on :8001 returns `{"service":"TCI ASR Service","version":"3.0.0","status":"running","features":{"speaker_registration":true,"zh_asr_backend":"/share/models/ASR/speech_paraformer-large_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch","en_asr_backend":"faster-whisper","speaker_backend":"/share/models/ASR/speech_eres2netv2_sv_zh-cn_16k-common","diarization_backend":"pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1"}}`. `GET /` on :8000 returns the "TCI Assessment System" v1.0.0 banner. `POST /api/transcribe`, `POST /api/resolve-speakers`, `POST /api/register-speaker` all accept unauthenticated requests and return processing results. The ffmpeg subprocess error is reflected verbatim in the JSON `error` field, producing a file-existence oracle over the server filesystem. `POST /api/auth/password-reset/request` returns HTTP 200. `:9000` MinIO returns HTTP 403 on `/`. |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated ASR ingest on `/api/transcribe`. Unauthenticated speaker-biometric registry access on `/api/register-speaker` and `/api/resolve-speakers`. Path-traversal file-existence oracle via the reflected ffmpeg error. Open account registration via the live password-reset / email-verification routes. Auth IS enforced on `/api/export/transcript/*` (401) — the posture is split. |
| **Severity** | **CRITICAL** — verified, directly-observed unauthenticated access to an ASR ingest and speaker-biometric platform processing kindergarten-age children's audio. The path-traversal oracle was confirmed against `/etc/passwd`-class system paths and the full container procfs. The children's-data class elevates the confidentiality impact. The CRITICAL label rests on the verified open endpoints and the verified traversal oracle, not on the data class alone — the data class makes a verified-CRITICAL exposure worse, it does not manufacture the tier. |

**Enumerated exploitation primitives (paths, not exercised attacks):**

1. **Unauthenticated ASR ingest** — `POST /api/transcribe` accepts audio without a token. An anonymous caller spends the platform's GPU compute on arbitrary audio. Confirmed: the endpoint processed probe requests and returned `task_id` values.
2. **ffmpeg path-traversal oracle** — `/api/transcribe` and `/api/resolve-speakers` pass a caller-supplied path to `ffmpeg -i <path>`. A non-existent path returns `Audio file not found: <path>`; an existing non-audio path returns `外部命令失败: ffmpeg ...`. The two distinct responses form a boolean file-existence oracle. Confirmed against `/proc/version`, `/proc/1/cmdline`, `/proc/1/environ`, `/proc/1/maps`, `/proc/net/tcp`, `/proc/self/*`, `/etc/environment`, and `/data/tci_system/.env` — all confirmed to exist. The `/etc/passwd`-class read is the canonical demonstration; the oracle confirms arbitrary path existence in the service user's view. It was driven against system paths only, never a child audio file.
3. **Speaker biometric registry** — `/api/register-speaker` and `/api/resolve-speakers` are unauthenticated. The platform stores speaker prototypes (voice prints) under `workdir/teacher_cache/<speaker_id>/`. Scopes `kindergarten`, `teacher`, `nanshan`, `school` were probed for directory existence — all returned `NO_DIR` at probe time. The registry endpoint is live and unauthenticated; no biometric prototype was retrieved.
4. **MinIO object store** — `:9000` is a MinIO S3 API returning HTTP 403 on `/`. The bucket layer is the likely store for the audio segments and the speaker prototypes. The 403 confirms an auth gate exists on the bucket root. Not enumerated.
5. **`/proc/environ` and container internals** — the ffmpeg oracle confirms `/proc/1/environ`, `/proc/1/cmdline`, and `/proc/1/maps` are all readable by the service user. An attacker who could exfiltrate file content through this path (the ffmpeg oracle itself truncates before environ content, but other primitives in the codebase may not) would recover container environment variables, the init command line, and the process memory map.
6. **Open account registration** — the `/api/auth/password-reset/request` route returns HTTP 200 and the `verify-email` route is live (400 on bad tokens). The registration layer accepts requests. Per the Insight #55 class, a self-registered account would then reach the auth-gated `/api/export/transcript/*` route — the export route's 401 is bypassed by becoming a legitimate user, not by breaking auth.

**Potential impact:** The unauthenticated `/api/transcribe` and speaker-registry endpoints place kindergarten-age children's audio and biometric voice prints in reach of any anonymous internet caller. The path-traversal oracle exposes the server filesystem layout and confirms the location of the audio working directory, the model store, and the MinIO credential files. An attacker who chains the open registration to the auth-gated transcript-export route reaches stored transcripts of children's speech assessments. The audio is the speech of named kindergarten children; the speaker prototypes are biometric identifiers of minors. Under any data-protection regime this is a child-biometric-data exposure. The combination of unauthenticated ingest, the filesystem oracle, the open registry, and open registration is the verified CRITICAL.

### Severity grouping

**CRITICAL** — 5.1 Pantaflow (verified unauth live-transcription platform, operator's production product) · 5.2 TCI (verified unauth kindergarten ASR + verified path-traversal oracle + verified open registration; children's-biometric-voice data class)

No MED, LOW, OBSERVED, or UNRATED findings this session. Both targeted hosts resolved to verified CRITICAL.

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Overall Posture

Both hosts confirm the Survey 17 category thesis. Voice/Audio AI skews Tier-A — "no auth concept" in the framework default — and the two hosts assessed this session are both unauthenticated on their primary surface. This is not isolated misconfiguration. It is the category-default failure: voice/audio projects ship as research code or self-host-the-demo wrappers, and operators deploy them raw because the hosting tutorials do not add auth. Pantaflow exposed its own commercial product. TCI exposed a children's speech-assessment platform. Neither is a test instance.

The two hosts differ in one important way. Pantaflow is a pure auth-on-default failure — every primitive is open. TCI is a split-auth failure — the transcript-export route is correctly 401-gated, while the ingest and speaker-registry routes are not. The split-auth pattern is the more dangerous of the two because the operator can point at the 401 on the export route and believe the platform is protected. It is not. The data-bearing ingest and registry routes are wide open, and the path-traversal oracle bypasses the application layer entirely.

### Confidentiality

This is the headline risk on both hosts and the reason both are CRITICAL.

- **Pantaflow:** live meeting transcripts. The WebSocket eavesdrop primitive streams the real-time transcription of whatever the operator's customers say in their meetings. The session-read primitive returns the full transcript of an active meeting. The data class is third-party business conversation.
- **TCI:** children's audio and children's biometric voice prints. The unauthenticated ASR ingest and the unauthenticated speaker registry both touch kindergarten-age children's speech. The speaker prototypes are biometric identifiers of minors. The path-traversal oracle additionally discloses the server filesystem layout and the location of the MinIO credential files. This is the most sensitive data class encountered in the Survey 17 series. A kindergarten speech-assessment platform is, by design, a database of children's voices.

### Integrity

- **Pantaflow:** an unauthenticated actor can clobber an active session (Primitive 3) or terminate it (Primitive 4), corrupting or destroying the transcript state of an in-progress meeting. The actor can also push arbitrary audio into the transcription engine, injecting false transcript content into a session.
- **TCI:** the speaker-registration endpoint is unauthenticated. An actor can register speaker prototypes, polluting the biometric registry. The unauthenticated transcribe endpoint accepts arbitrary audio, allowing injection of fabricated assessment input.

### Availability

- **Pantaflow:** the session-clobber and session-terminate primitives are a direct denial-of-service against any in-progress meeting. The unauthenticated :8000 Whisper playground accepts arbitrary audio with no rate limit and no file-size cap — a compute-exhaustion vector against the operator's GPU.
- **TCI:** the unauthenticated `/api/transcribe` endpoint spends the platform's ASR compute on any caller's audio with no rate limit observed. Compute drain is the availability vector.

### Systemic Patterns

- **Category-default propagation (Insight #13).** Both hosts inherit the auth-off posture of the upstream voice/audio projects they were built from. faster-whisper-server, the Whisper streaming backends, and the pyannote diarization stack all ship without auth. The shipping default is load-bearing — the population-scale exposure rate tracks the default, not operator intent.
- **The custom-wrapper blind spot.** Neither `:8001` service is in the aimap fingerprint catalog. Both are bespoke FastAPI apps wrapping standard ASR backends. aimap fingerprints the backends (faster-whisper, MinIO) but not the operator's custom front-end API. A custom wrapper around a known-insecure backend is a recurring class the catalog does not yet cover.
- **The split-auth trap.** TCI is the session's clearest systemic lesson. Auth enforced on one route (`/api/export/transcript/*` → 401) and absent on the data-bearing routes (`/api/transcribe`, `/api/register-speaker`) produces an operator who believes the platform is protected. Per Insight #16, the 401 on the export route is platform behavior on that route, not the auth state of the platform. Each route must be checked independently. A scanner that probes the export route, sees 401, and labels the host "protected" is wrong.
- **The error-message oracle.** TCI reflects the raw ffmpeg subprocess error into the API response. This is a generic anti-pattern: any service that passes a caller-supplied path to a subprocess and reflects the subprocess error builds a file-existence oracle for free. The fix is to never reflect subprocess stderr to an unauthenticated caller.

## 7. Recommendations

### R1 — Pantaflow: Authenticate the Live-Transcription Session API

```python
# FastAPI: gate every session route behind a bearer token.
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, Header

async def require_token(authorization: str = Header(...)):
    if authorization != f"Bearer {SESSION_API_TOKEN}":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401)

@app.post("/session/start", dependencies=[Depends(require_token)])
async def session_start(meeting_id: str): ...
```

Every route — `GET /session`, `POST /session/start`, `POST /session/end`, `POST /audio` — and both WebSocket endpoints must require the token. The WebSocket handler must reject the connection before the upgrade if the token is absent. A live-transcription platform with no auth is a public meeting-eavesdrop service.

### R2 — Pantaflow: Bind the Whisper Playground or Add Auth

The `:8000` faster-whisper-server should not be on the public internet. Bind it to localhost and reach it only from the `:8001` service, or place it behind the same bearer-token gate. As deployed it is free Whisper compute for any caller.

### R3 — TCI: Authenticate the ASR Ingest and Speaker-Registry Routes

This platform handles kindergarten-age children's audio and biometric voice data. The remediation framing must start from that fact. `POST /api/transcribe`, `POST /api/register-speaker`, and `POST /api/resolve-speakers` must require authentication, the same as the already-gated `/api/export/transcript/*` route. The current split posture — export gated, ingest and registry open — is the failure. Auth must be enforced uniformly across every route that touches a child's audio or a child's voice print.

```python
# Apply the same auth dependency the export route already uses
# to the ingest and speaker-registry routes — uniformly, no exceptions.
@app.post("/api/transcribe", dependencies=[Depends(require_auth)])
@app.post("/api/register-speaker", dependencies=[Depends(require_auth)])
@app.post("/api/resolve-speakers", dependencies=[Depends(require_auth)])
```

### R4 — TCI: Stop Reflecting Subprocess Errors; Validate the Path

```python
# Never pass a caller-supplied path straight to ffmpeg.
# Validate against an allow-listed audio directory and a known extension.
import os
AUDIO_ROOT = "/data/tci_system/asr-service/workdir/audio"

def safe_audio_path(user_path: str) -> str:
    full = os.path.realpath(os.path.join(AUDIO_ROOT, user_path))
    if not full.startswith(AUDIO_ROOT + os.sep):
        raise ValueError("path outside audio root")
    if not full.lower().endswith((".wav", ".mp3", ".m4a", ".flac")):
        raise ValueError("not an audio file")
    return full
```

On any failure, return a generic error message. Do not return the ffmpeg stderr. The reflected subprocess error is the file-existence oracle — removing the reflection removes the oracle.

### R5 — TCI: Close Open Registration; Harden the MinIO Bucket

Disable self-service account registration, or gate it behind administrator approval. A platform holding children's biometric data should not accept anonymous account creation — the open-registration route is the bypass for the otherwise-gated transcript-export route. Separately, confirm the MinIO `:9000` bucket policy is not anonymous-readable beyond the root 403, and bind MinIO to a private interface.

### R6 — TCI: Network-Bind the Platform

The whole stack — `:8000`, `:8001`, `:9000` — should sit behind a reverse proxy with auth, or be bound to a private network and reached over a VPN. A children's speech-assessment platform has no reason to expose an ASR ingest API to the public internet.

### Future automation

```bash
# aimap: add a custom-ASR-wrapper fingerprint class.
# The backends (faster-whisper, MinIO) are already fingerprinted;
# the operator's bespoke FastAPI front-end is the gap.
aimap -list voice-audio-hosts.txt -ports 8000,8001,9000,7860 \
      -probe-paths /session,/api/transcribe,/api/register-speaker \
      -o voice-audio-report.json

# Split-auth detection: probe multiple routes per host, not one.
# A 401 on one route does not clear the host.
for route in /api/transcribe /api/export/transcript/1 /api/register-speaker; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} ${route}\n" "http://${host}${route}"
done

# Subprocess-error-oracle detection: send a known-bad path,
# flag any response that reflects an ffmpeg/subprocess error string.
```

The split-auth probe is the load-bearing addition. The TCI host would read as "protected" to any scanner that checks one route. Probing multiple routes per host and flagging a host where some routes are gated and others are not surfaces the Insight #16 split-auth class at population scale.

## 8. Limitations and Assumptions

| # | Limitation | Risk Implication |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Analysis reconstructed from case studies and session notes. This session was not assigned a session number; execution trace timestamps are approximate. | Trace timing is indicative, not exact; the ordering and outcomes are accurate. |
| L2 | Exploitation pathways were enumerated to confirm severity; none were exercised against operator data. | The Pantaflow primitives and the TCI traversal oracle are confirmed-reachable paths. The active-meeting behavior on Pantaflow and the in-registry biometric data on TCI are characterized from the endpoint contract and probe responses, not from extracted data. |
| L3 | No children's data was accessed or exfiltrated on TCI. The ffmpeg oracle was driven against system paths only. | The children's-audio and biometric-voice exposure is established by the open endpoints and the confirmed traversal oracle. The volume and content of stored child data is not quantified — the restraint ethic forbids it. |
| L4 | Shodan API credits exhausted; VisorSD and VisorPlus ran dry-run. Discovery relied on the JAXEN tier-2 harvest on disk. | The two hosts are confirmed. The broader Survey 17 voice/audio population at population scale is not re-counted this session. |
| L5 | aimap v1.9.24 has no fingerprint for either custom `:8001` service. Both were fingerprinted by manual banner read. | Population expansion via an aimap batch is not possible until a custom-ASR-wrapper fingerprint ships. |
| L6 | VisorScuba could not score either host — ECS field-mapping gap still open. | No automated compliance score for this session; scoring deferred. |
| L7 | TCI attribution to CUHK-SZ / Nanshan kindergarten network is inferred from the probed scope names (`nanshan`, `kindergarten`, `teacher`), the "TCI Assessment System" banner, and the China host location. The exact operating institution is not confirmed by a registration record. | The classification as a K12/kindergarten ASR platform is well-supported by the platform's own banners and scopes; the specific named operator is an inference. |
| L8 | The TCI `/proc/1/environ` extraction attempt produced nothing — ffmpeg stderr truncates before environ content. | Environment variables were not recovered. Other primitives in the TCI codebase may not truncate the same way; this was not tested (restraint). |

## 9. Proof of Concept (PoC) Illustrations

> PoCs use minimal, read-only interactions. No operator data extracted. No credentials used. No exploit payloads. No children's data in any PoC. Each PoC shows the door is open. None of them walk through it.

### PoC 1: Pantaflow — Unauthenticated `:8001` Endpoint Reachability

**Scenario:** An external party with no credentials confirms the Pantaflow live-transcription session API is reachable and unauthenticated.

```
REQUEST:
  GET /session HTTP/1.1
  Host: 116.202.28.181:8001

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Server: uvicorn
  Content-Type: application/json

  {"session":{"id":null,"started_at":null,"transcripts":[],"full_text":""},"transcript_count":0}
```

**Demonstrated:** The session API answers an anonymous GET with HTTP 200 and a session object — no 401, no auth challenge. The idle response shown above carries an empty session. During an active meeting the same endpoint returns the session ID, the start timestamp, and the live transcript. The PoC confirms the endpoint is open and unauthenticated. It does not capture any meeting transcript — no meeting was active and none was started. The door is open; the PoC reads the doorplate and stops.

### PoC 2: TCI — Unauthenticated `:8001` ASR Service Banner

**Scenario:** An external party confirms the TCI kindergarten ASR service is reachable and self-describing without authentication.

```
REQUEST:
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: 117.50.80.181:8001

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Server: uvicorn
  Content-Type: application/json

  {"service":"TCI ASR Service","version":"3.0.0","status":"running",
   "features":{"denoising":false,"segment_saving":true,"classification":false,
   "speaker_registration":true,
   "zh_asr_backend":"/share/models/ASR/speech_paraformer-large_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch",
   "en_asr_backend":"faster-whisper",
   "speaker_backend":"/share/models/ASR/speech_eres2netv2_sv_zh-cn_16k-common",
   "diarization_backend":"pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1"}}
```

**Demonstrated:** The ASR service answers an anonymous GET with its full feature set — speaker registration enabled, Chinese and English ASR backends, pyannote diarization. The banner alone identifies a speaker-biometric speech-assessment platform. The PoC confirms the service is live and unauthenticated on the root. It transcribes no audio and registers no speaker.

### PoC 3: TCI — Path-Traversal File-Existence Oracle (Conceptual, System Paths Only)

**Scenario:** An external party demonstrates that the TCI transcribe endpoint reflects the ffmpeg subprocess error, turning a caller-supplied path into a boolean file-existence oracle. Shown against a system path only.

```
REQUEST:
  POST /api/transcribe HTTP/1.1
  Host: 117.50.80.181:8001
  Content-Type: application/json

  {"audio_path": "<system-path>"}      # e.g. /etc/passwd or /proc/version — NEVER a child audio file

RESPONSE (path exists, not an audio file):
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {"status":"failed","transcripts":[],"task_id":"<uuid>",
   "error":"外部命令失败: ffmpeg -y -i <system-path> -ar 16000 -ac 1 .../cache/<name>.wav\n
            ffmpeg version 4.4.2 ... [mpegts] Format detected only with low score ..."}

RESPONSE (path does not exist):
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {"status":"failed", ... "error":"Audio file not found: <system-path>"}
```

**Demonstrated:** Two distinct error strings — `外部命令失败: ffmpeg ...` for an existing non-audio file, `Audio file not found` for a missing path — form a boolean oracle over the server filesystem. In this assessment the oracle was driven only against system and structural paths: `/proc/version`, `/proc/1/cmdline`, `/proc/1/environ`, `/etc/environment`, `/data/tci_system/.env`, and the workdir directory tree. Every one was confirmed to exist. The placeholder `<system-path>` above is exactly that — a placeholder for a system path. The oracle is equally capable of confirming the existence of an individual child audio file under the workdir cache. It was never pointed at one. The PoC proves the traversal works against the filesystem layout. It does not read, locate, or confirm any child's data. That is the boundary, and the boundary held.

### PoC 4: TCI — Split-Auth Posture (Export Gated, Ingest Open)

**Scenario:** An external party demonstrates the split-auth posture — the transcript-export route is gated, the data-bearing ingest route is not. This is the Insight #16 verification lesson in one host.

```
REQUEST A (the route a one-route scanner would check):
  GET /api/export/transcript/1 HTTP/1.1
  Host: 117.50.80.181:8001

RESPONSE A:
  HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized        # scanner sees this, labels host "protected"

REQUEST B (the route that actually bears the data):
  POST /api/register-speaker HTTP/1.1
  Host: 117.50.80.181:8001
  Content-Type: application/json

  {"speaker_id":"<probe>","speaker_name":"<probe>"}

RESPONSE B:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK                  # processed, unauthenticated — no 401
  {"status":"failed","speaker_id":"<probe>", ... }
```

**Demonstrated:** Request A returns 401. A scanner that probes only the export route stops here and calls the host protected. Request B — the unauthenticated speaker-registry route — returns HTTP 200 and processes the request. The auth posture is split: the export route is gated, the ingest and speaker-registry routes are not. Per Insight #16, the 401 on Request A is the behavior of that one route, not the auth state of the platform. The PoC sends a probe `speaker_id`; it registers no real speaker and reads no real biometric prototype. It demonstrates the split, and nothing else.
