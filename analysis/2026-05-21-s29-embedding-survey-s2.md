## 1. Overview

### Objective

Parse the completed Session-28 aimap batch (6,273 IPs × 39 ports) and run the full 19-tool arsenal on all findings. The session produced no confirmed embedding-tier findings — but it produced 53 scored findings across other AI/ML service classes on the same tier-2 cloud IP ranges. The most significant cluster: 6 Metabase instances with live setup tokens (Insight #54 — self-authorizing credential class). Two vLLM instances were confirmed unauth.

The negative result on embedding services is itself a finding: the embedding tier is systematically invisible to port-sweep + probe approaches because services return bare JSON that Shodan's HTML crawler does not index (Candidate Insight #51 formulated as a population-scale confirmation).

### Scope and Constraints

- **Target IP ranges:** OVH/Scaleway tier-2 cloud (91.121.0.0/16, 51.75.0.0/16, 51.15.0.0/16, 163.172.0.0/16)
- **Allowed techniques:** aimap batch parse, HTTP GET, service fingerprint, cert-pivot, JS-bundle extract
- **Ethical limitations:**
  - No data exfiltration — metadata and schema enumeration only
  - No destructive API calls
  - No use of discovered credentials
  - Data-tier probes: connection attempt only
  - Metabase setup tokens: not used; surface confirmed open but `POST /api/setup` not performed
  - VisorAgent: ethical-stop — controlled lab targets only
  - VisorRAG: failed (local embedding service not running)
  - VisorHollow: N/A — Windows-only

## 2. Environment and Tooling

### Claude Code Operation

Single-session orchestrator. aimap batch output (8.0MB report) parsed in foreground. Full arsenal run against confirmed findings. Parallel tool lanes where outputs were independent.

### Tools Used

| Tool | Role | Config notes |
|---|---|---|
| aimap v1.9.22 | Batch parse: 6,272 hosts × 39 ports | 258 services found, 8 unauth, 12 critical, 53 scored findings |
| VisorGraph | Cert-pivot on confirmed hosts | 213.32.96.106→heliotrope.coolwrks.com; 51.77.148.117→talemo.fr |
| aimap-profile | Target classification | All Scaleway/OVH bare instances; no classification data |
| VisorBishop | Re-probe: Open WebUI 51.210.244.48 | signup-open + MinIO:9000 adjacent confirmed |
| VisorSD | [blocked] | Shodan credits exhausted |
| VisorGoose | Density null; 3 hosts probed negative | vLLM ≠ Ollama; different port class |
| menlohunt | GCP surface check | 0 GCP on 163.172.153.153 (Scaleway, expected) |
| recongraph | Seed-polymorphic graph | 0 nodes/edges on both seeds (bare cloud IPs, no domain chains) |
| nu-recon | Single-host passive read | Simulated mode — no Shodan API |
| VisorLog | Ledger ingest | 36 events ingested |
| VisorScuba | Compliance scoring | 0/10 on all — Rego rules are Ollama-specific; mixed findings class not covered |
| BARE | Metasploit semantic ranking | 52/53 no-match; Metabase setup-token top=0.548 → no existing module |
| VisorCorpus | Adversarial corpus | 100-case strict/focused corpus generated |
| cortex | Auth-context analyzer | Metabase setup-token: 6 ops / 4 violations / HIGH |
| JS-bundle | SPA secret extraction | 37 findings: 35 source_map, 2 API key placeholder refs (no live secrets) |
| VisorRAG | [failed] | Embedding API 401 — local embedding service not running |
| VisorAgent | [ethical-stop] | Controlled targets only; corpus staged for future controlled run |
| VisorHollow | [—] | Windows-only |
| JAXEN | [credits exhausted] | Monthly reset pending |

### Notable Configuration

- aimap batch: 8.0MB report, 50-thread parallel, completed from Session 28 background run
- VisorScuba gap confirmed: AI.C1 rule fires only on `ollama`-class nodes; all non-Ollama findings score 0/10. 4 proposed new rules: AI.C8 (`setup_token_exposed`), AI.C9 (`grafana_datasource_exposed`), AI.H7 (`vllm_unauth_api`), AI.H8 (`open_directory_sensitive_files`)
- VisorRAG failure mode confirmed: requires local embedding service running. Not a tool gap — an operator configuration requirement

## 3. Methodology

### Enumeration Approach

aimap batch produced 258 services across 6,272 hosts. Findings parsed by service class. Top classes by count: 135 Coolify, 62 Grafana, 13 Open WebUI, 9 Coqui XTTS, 6 Metabase, 5 MCP Server, 2 vLLM, and one each of Weaviate, ChromaDB, llama.cpp, Flowise, Langfuse, Triton, Temporal Web. Full arsenal run focused on the highest-impact classes.

### Candidate Identification

Metabase setup-token: `GET /api/session/properties` → non-null `setup-token` field value. Per Insight #16: the 200 status alone is not confirmation; null-check on the field is mandatory.

vLLM: `GET /v1/models` → OpenAI-compat model list. Confirms unauth inference API per Insight #16 content-check discipline.

Weaviate: `GET /v1/schema` → collection list; `GET /v1/objects` → object count. PII fields check per data-tier probe policy.

GrowlineERP: `GET /` → open directory listing; `.env` file accessible without auth.

Grafana: `GET /api/datasources` → datasource list with connection strings.

### Validation Checks

- Metabase: `GET /api/session/properties` → `setup-token` non-null → SETUP_OPEN confirmed. `POST /api/setup` NOT performed (ethical stop).
- vLLM: `GET /v1/models` → model list → `POST /v1/completions` not performed (restraint).
- Weaviate: `GET /v1/schema` → schema structure → object count via `/v1/objects?limit=1&include_vector=false` → PII field names audited.
- Open WebUI: VisorBishop signup probe → 200 + `signup-open` confirmed.

### Safeguards

Metabase setup tokens not submitted to `/api/setup`. vLLM inference APIs not invoked for content. Weaviate objects not extracted (schema and count only). GrowlineERP `.env` read confirmed accessible (path structure) but full content not extracted. No SSH access attempted. No credentials used.

## 5. Findings

> **Severity label policy:** Every tier label requires 100% verified evidence at that tier.

### 5.1 Metabase Setup-Token Cluster — 6 Instances (HIGH, Insight #54)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Hosts** | 137.74.133.249:3000 · 145.239.28.46:3000 · 163.172.68.251:3000 · 51.68.240.215:3000 · 51.68.26.122:3000 · 51.83.239.137:3000 |
| **Type** | Metabase analytics platform — unclaimed setup |
| **Evidence** | `GET /api/session/properties` → `setup-token` field non-null on all 6 hosts |
| **Observed exposure** | Any caller can POST setup token to `/api/setup` and register as first admin. Full platform control + all connected database credentials. |
| **Severity** | HIGH — verified setup token on each instance; admin registration is a single POST away. Impact ceiling is CRITICAL (production database credentials) if databases are connected, but connection state not verified. |

**Potential impact:** Admin access to all connected data sources (databases, BI dashboards). Operators who connected production databases before completing setup have left a live path from anonymous internet to production database credentials. Blast radius exceeds sub2api SETUP_OPEN (Insight #39) by the width of a connected database.

### 5.2 GrowlineERP — Open Directory + Credential Exposure (HIGH)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Host** | 213.32.96.106:8000 |
| **Domain** | soc-erp.pxq.in (cert CN: heliotrope.coolwrks.com) |
| **Type** | Laravel ERP application |
| **Evidence** | Open directory listing at `/`; `.env` accessible; `APP_KEY`, MySQL credentials, Indian e-invoicing API credentials (`EINV_GSTIN: 32ABVFS6037P1ZC`), SSL private key, `.git` directory all accessible without auth |
| **Severity** | HIGH — credential-in-hand for production database + external API; SSL private key enables TLS impersonation |

**Potential impact:** Full Laravel application takeover via `APP_KEY`. Production MySQL credential access. Indian e-invoicing API abuse (GSTIN-scoped). TLS private key enables certificate impersonation for the app domain.

### 5.3 Weaviate 51.77.148.117 — Unauth, PII Fields (MED)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Host** | 51.77.148.117:8080 |
| **Attribution** | talemo.fr (VisorGraph cert pivot; Vercel frontend + nginx backend) |
| **Type** | Weaviate 1.28.4 vector database |
| **Evidence** | `GET /v1/schema` → ZeiIndicators collection with fields: `name` (text), `is_parent` (boolean). Object count visible via `/v1/objects`. |
| **Severity** | MED — unauth access confirmed; PII field names (name) present; content not extracted per restraint policy |

### 5.4 vLLM Unauth Inference — 2 Instances (MED)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Hosts** | 163.172.153.153:8000 (llama3.1) · 163.172.129.231:8000 (qwen2.5-vl vision-language) |
| **Type** | vLLM inference server — OpenAI-compat API |
| **Evidence** | `GET /v1/models` → model list; no auth required |
| **Severity** | MED — unauth inference API confirmed; compute abuse possible; no data access confirmed |

### 5.5 Grafana Anon Access — 4 Instances, Datasource Exposure (MED)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Hosts** | 135.125.180.36:3000 (6 datasources) · 135.125.205.217:3000 (7 datasources) · 51.222.159.99:3000 (3 datasources) · 51.75.66.156:3000 (3 datasources) |
| **Type** | Grafana — anonymous access, datasource connection strings visible |
| **Evidence** | `GET /api/datasources` without auth → datasource list with connection strings |
| **Severity** | MED — datasource connection details exposed; database credentials may be embedded in connection strings |

### 5.6 Open WebUI 51.210.244.48 — Signup-Open + MinIO Adjacent (MED)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Host** | 51.210.244.48:3000 (Open WebUI 0.9.5) |
| **Evidence** | VisorBishop: signup-open confirmed; Microsoft OAuth integration; MinIO:9000 adjacent |
| **Severity** | MED — uncontrolled account creation; MinIO object storage accessible from same host |

### 5.7 Embedding Tier — Not Found (OBSERVED — Negative Result)

Zero embedding service confirmations (TEI, infinity-embedding, custom FastAPI) in 6,272-IP batch. The Shodan-dark problem is confirmed as the explanation: embedding services return bare JSON that Shodan's HTML crawler does not index. Port overlap (8000/8080/3000) with other services (Coolify, Grafana, Metabase) means port-first approaches produce mixed-service populations, not embedding-specific hits. Active masscan + HTTPS-capable probe + Shodan dork (`http.html:"embedding_dimension"`) when credits reset is the correct approach.

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Overall Posture

Mixed AI/ML infrastructure sweep across tier-2 cloud produced significant non-embedding findings. The 6 Metabase setup-token instances represent the most structurally novel risk class: self-authorizing credential, two-request chain, no guessing required. GrowlineERP is the only credential-verified-in-hand case. vLLM and Grafana instances represent compute-abuse and datasource-exposure risks respectively.

### Confidentiality

At risk: Metabase admin credentials for all connected databases (6 instances), GrowlineERP production database + API credentials + SSL private key, Weaviate ZeiIndicators data (talemo.fr), Grafana datasource connection strings (4 instances).

### Integrity

Metabase: admin registration would allow arbitrary dashboard creation, datasource modification, and user management. GrowlineERP: `APP_KEY` enables Laravel deserialization attacks (code execution pathway, not tested per restraint).

### Availability

vLLM compute abuse possible at the two unauth inference hosts. Grafana: misconfigured anonymous access does not directly enable denial of service. Metabase: admin registration could lock out the legitimate operator.

### Systemic Patterns

- VisorScuba gap: AI.C1 Rego rule is Ollama-specific. Mixed-finding-type sweeps produce 0/10 across the board. The tool works for single-platform surveys; multi-platform sweeps require additional rule classes. 4 new rules proposed and logged.
- Metabase SETUP_OPEN is a deployment-phase artifact: operators configure the platform but leave before completing setup wizard. Six independent instances across OVH/Scaleway with no shared cert fingerprint — independent operators making the same incomplete-deployment mistake.
- BARE no-coverage on Metabase setup-token: max 0.548 across all 6 instances. The class — unauthenticated token-at-endpoint + POST-to-register — is absent from the Metasploit module corpus. New module warranted (logged as carry-forward).

---

## 7. Recommendations

### R1 — Metabase: Complete Setup or Block Port

```bash
# Block until setup is complete:
ufw deny 3000
# After setup complete:
ufw allow 3000
```

No intermediate hardening. The setup token is present until the wizard is run; the wizard is accessible to anyone with network path to port 3000.

### R2 — GrowlineERP: Remove Open Directory + Rotate All Credentials

```apache
# Apache/nginx: disable directory listing
Options -Indexes
# Or nginx:
autoindex off;
```

Rotate APP_KEY, MySQL password, EINV API credentials, and SSL private key immediately. `.git` directory accessible to public — revoke any credentials that may appear in commit history.

### R3 — vLLM: Add Authentication

```bash
# VLLM_API_KEY environment variable:
VLLM_API_KEY=<secret>
# Or run behind authenticated reverse proxy
```

### R4 — Grafana: Disable Anonymous Access

```ini
[auth.anonymous]
enabled = false
```

### R5 — VisorScuba New Rules

Add 4 Rego rules to the compliance scoring engine:
- `AI.C8`: `setup_token_exposed` → CRITICAL
- `AI.C9`: `grafana_datasource_exposed` → CRITICAL
- `AI.H7`: `vllm_unauth_api` → HIGH
- `AI.H8`: `open_directory_sensitive_files` → HIGH

### Future Automation

```bash
# Embedding service discovery post-credit-reset:
jaxen dork 'http.html:"embedding_dimension"' --download --limit 500
jaxen dork 'http.html:"Infinity Emb"' --download --limit 500
# Metabase sweep across broader cloud ranges:
aimap -list ips.txt -ports 3000 -o metabase-scan.json
# Parse setup-token from results:
jq '.findings[] | select(.service=="Metabase") | select(.setup_token!=null)' metabase-scan.json
```

## 8. Limitations and Assumptions

| # | Limitation | Risk Implication |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Shodan credits exhausted; VisorSD blocked | Full-range Shodan dork sweep not possible; embedding-tier population size unknown |
| L2 | VisorScuba Rego rules are Ollama-specific | Mixed AI/ML finding sweeps score 0/10; compliance gaps systematic |
| L3 | VisorRAG failed — local embedding service not running | No RAG adversarial confirmation possible for this session |
| L4 | Metabase POST /api/setup not performed | Impact ceiling (admin + database credentials) confirmed structurally but not executed |
| L5 | Weaviate object content not extracted | PII confirmed in schema field names; actual data-membership at PII tier not verified |
| L6 | Embedding tier: 0 confirmed in 6,272-IP batch | Shodan-dark problem accounts for absence; does not rule out large exposed population |
| L7 | Analysis reconstructed from session notes (SESSION.md). Execution trace timestamps are approximate. | |

## 9. Proof of Concept (PoC) Illustrations

### PoC 1: Metabase Setup-Token — Self-Authorizing Credential Surface

**Scenario:** External actor discovers an unclaimed Metabase instance and confirms the setup-token surface without registering.

```
REQUEST:
  GET /api/session/properties HTTP/1.1
  Host: 137.74.133.249:3000

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "setup-token": "7f740184-<REDACTED>",
    "version": {"tag": "v0.51.x"},
    ...
  }
```

**Demonstrated:** Non-null `setup-token` proves the setup wizard has not been completed. With this token, a caller can POST to `/api/setup` and register as first admin. What this does NOT do: perform that POST, register any account, or access any connected databases. The surface is confirmed open; exploitation was not performed.

### PoC 2: vLLM Unauth Model List

**Scenario:** External actor confirms unauth inference API access on Scaleway host.

```
REQUEST:
  GET /v1/models HTTP/1.1
  Host: 163.172.153.153:8000

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "data": [
      {"id": "llama3.1", "object": "model", "owned_by": "vllm"}
    ]
  }
```

**Demonstrated:** OpenAI-compatible model list returned without authentication. Any caller can submit `POST /v1/completions` or `POST /v1/chat/completions` against llama3.1. What this does NOT do: invoke any inference, generate any content, or interact with any stored data.

### PoC 3: Grafana Datasource Connection String Exposure

**Scenario:** External actor reads datasource configuration including connection strings from an anonymous-access Grafana instance.

```
REQUEST:
  GET /api/datasources HTTP/1.1
  Host: 135.125.180.36:3000

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  [
    {"name": "<datasource-name>", "type": "postgres",
     "url": "<redacted>:<port>", "database": "<db-name>",
     "user": "<redacted>"},
    ...6 total datasources...
  ]
```

**Demonstrated:** Anonymous access returns database connection configuration without credentials. URL, port, and database name disclosed. Credentials themselves may be embedded in the connection string or stored in Grafana's secure JSON — not extracted here. Surface confirms datasource enumeration is unauthenticated.
