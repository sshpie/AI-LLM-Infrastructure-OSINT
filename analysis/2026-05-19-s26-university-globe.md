# Session Analysis: Global University LLM-Exposure Hunt + Live Globe

**Date:** 2026-05-19
**Session:** 26
**Classification:** Internal / Research Use Only
**Toolchain:** Custom pipeline (harvest.py · institution-sweep.py · attribute.py · verify.py · geo-enrich.py · build-findings-json.py · build-findings-public.py) · julius (63-service LLM fingerprinter) · globe.gl (3D visualization) · Shodan CLI · Astro (site build)
**Repos updated:** AI-LLM-Infrastructure-OSINT (AF25c80, c7590ac, 4575c2d, fd60c81) · portfolio (sshpie.github.io, c7590ac build fix)

---

## 1. Overview

### Objective

Map exposed LLM infrastructure at every university worldwide. Scope: 10,224 institutions across 202 countries (Hipo world-universities dataset). The framing is the hunt, not a checklist: find what is actually reachable and visible, produce a public artifact from the research, and build a pipeline that can be resumed.

The session built a full pipeline from scratch, completed Lane A (academic-TLD harvest + verify + attribute), started Lane B (per-institution domain sweep for plain-ccTLD universities not caught by `hostname:.edu/.ac.*`), and deployed a live 3D globe at `/map/universities/`.

### Scope and Constraints

- **Target domains:** `hostname:.edu`, `hostname:.ac.uk`, `hostname:.edu.au`, `hostname:.ac.jp`, `hostname:.ac.kr` (Lane A) · per-institution `hostname:<domain>` (Lane B)
- **Allowed techniques:** Shodan harvest, CT-log lookup, DNS, HTTP GET probe (marker probes only — restraint-bound)
- **Ethical limitations:**
  - No data exfiltration — metadata and schema enumeration only
  - No destructive API calls
  - No use of discovered credentials
  - Data-tier probes: connection attempt only
  - VisorAgent: controlled lab targets only, never operator hosts
  - Personal-device and wrong-category targets: archived without outreach

## 2. Environment and Tooling

### Claude Code Operation

Pipeline-build session. Six Python scripts written and sequenced as a resumable pipeline. `julius` installed as a companion LLM fingerprinter. Lane B runs as a resumable background sweep with state checkpointing. Site deploy via Astro submodule pull — OSINT repo content error broke the portfolio build; fixed in-session (c7590ac).

### Tools Used

| Tool | Role | Config notes |
|---|---|---|
| JAXEN | Stage-0 Shodan harvest per academic-TLD dork matrix | 18-dork × 4-TLD cross-product |
| harvest.py | Academic-TLD Shodan harvest coordinator | Custom script; `~/recon/global-university-llm-map/` |
| institution-sweep.py | Per-institution `hostname:<domain>` sweep | Resumable; checkpointed state; Lane B |
| attribute.py | IP → institution attribution via Hipo dataset | 10,224-institution JSON; rDNS + cert + org-name matching |
| verify.py | Restraint-bound marker probes per platform class | HTTP GET only; no write-tier; no auth bypass |
| geo-enrich.py | Institution → lat/lon enrichment for globe | Hipo dataset geographic data |
| build-findings-json.py | Findings → canonical JSON feed | Full findings for internal use |
| build-findings-public.py | Anonymizer — strips host/IP/institution | Lat/lon jittered ±38km for public display |
| julius | 63-service LLM fingerprinter | Installed at `~/go/bin/julius` |
| globe.gl | 3D globe visualization | Astro page in portfolio repo |

### Notable Configuration

- Public feed anonymization: no host, no IP, no institution name in public JSON. Lat/lon jittered ±38km (city-level precision). Country + exposure-class explainers only.
- Lane B checkpoint interval: state written per institution so sweep is fully resumable on interruption.
- Astro build fix required: `methodology/insight-38-litellm-model-impersonation-fraud.md` had an unquoted YAML colon in the `title:` field. Broke the entire site build (OSINT is a submodule; content parse errors cascade). Quoted it → commit c7590ac → build restored.
- Globe features: country dropdown + list, pause-rotation toggle, click-dot detail panel with exposure-class explainers. Existing `/map` page untouched.

## 3. Methodology

### Enumeration Approach

**Lane A (academic-TLD):** 18-dork count matrix × 4 academic TLDs (`.edu`, `.ac.uk`, `.edu.au`, `.ac.jp`) → Shodan harvest per productive dork → verify per host → attribute to institution via Hipo dataset.

**Lane B (per-institution domain):** Iterate all 10,224 Hipo institutions. For each, run `hostname:<institution_domain>` Shodan query across AI/LLM port set. Checkpoint after every institution. Resumable at any interruption point.

### Candidate Identification

Platform fingerprinting per class:
- Jupyter/JupyterHub: html body + title markers + `/hub/login` path
- Ollama: port 11434 + `/api/tags` JSON structure
- Open WebUI: title + uvicorn header + `/api/version`
- LiteLLM: `/openapi.json` schema match
- Streamlit: port 8501 + Streamlit-specific headers

Exposure classification:
- `signup-open`: POST to registration endpoint → 200 + FIELD_ERROR
- `llmjacking`: `/api/tags` returns `:cloud`-suffix model entries
- `litellm-openapi-public`: `/openapi.json` accessible without auth
- `jupyterhub-info-public`: hub config endpoint returns server list
- `jupyterhub-auth-enforced`: hub login required, no bypass

### Validation Checks

verify.py runs marker probes only. Per Insight #16: status code alone is not identity. Content-check is required for each platform class. Geo-enrich adds institution attribution via Hipo dataset lookup on rDNS and cert CN.

### Safeguards

Public-feed anonymizer strips all operator-identifying data before publishing. Lab coordinates jittered so exact campus location is not disclosed. No credentials used. No model invocations performed. VisorAgent + VisorRAG deferred to controlled-target sessions only.

## 5. Findings

> **Severity label policy:** Every tier label requires 100% verified evidence. Lane A verify.py applies marker probes; findings at this level are probe-confirmed.

### 5.1 Lane A: LLMjacking-Class Instances (HIGH)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Count** | 16 hosts across academic TLDs with `:cloud`-suffix Ollama models |
| **Type** | Ollama-Cloud-signin × public exposure (Insight #49) |
| **Evidence** | `/api/tags` returns `:cloud` entries on each host |
| **Severity** | HIGH — class-membership confirmed per Insight #49 methodology; data-membership (quota consumption) not test-verified (restraint) |

**Potential impact:** Operator Ollama Cloud subscription quota exposed to public invocation across 16 academic hosts globally.

### 5.2 Lane A: Signup-Open LLM Platforms (MED)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Count** | 21 hosts across academic TLDs |
| **Platform classes** | Open WebUI, Dify, n8n, other registration-enabled platforms |
| **Evidence** | POST to registration endpoint → HTTP 200 + FIELD_ERROR or account-creation confirmation |
| **Severity** | MED — signup-open confirmed; post-registration access scope not enumerated per restraint policy |

### 5.3 Lane A: LiteLLM OpenAPI Public (LOW)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Count** | 33 hosts |
| **Evidence** | `/openapi.json` returns full API schema without auth |
| **Severity** | LOW — endpoint and model-routing schema disclosed; no credential or data access |

### 5.4 Lane A: JupyterHub Auth-Enforced (OBSERVED)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Count** | 378 hosts |
| **Evidence** | `/hub/login` returns login page; no bypass |
| **Observed** | Dominant class; confirms auth-on-default posture for JupyterHub at academic scale |

### 5.5 Lane A: JupyterHub Info-Public (LOW)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Count** | 170 hosts |
| **Evidence** | Hub configuration endpoint returns server list or named-server info without auth |
| **Severity** | LOW — server list disclosure; no model or user-data access |

### 5.6 Lane B: Partially Complete (UNRATED)

~2,200 of 10,224 institutions swept at session end. Findings pending complete run. Per-institution domain sweep catches non-`.edu`/non-`.ac.*` universities (national ccTLDs, custom domains) that Lane A misses entirely.

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Overall Posture

742 confirmed platform findings across 40 countries and 206 institutions from Lane A alone. The dominant class is auth-enforced (378 JupyterHub). The exposure classes of concern: 16 LLMjacking-class instances (operator quota at risk) and 21 signup-open platforms (uncontrolled account creation). Lane B completion will extend these numbers.

### Confidentiality

LLMjacking instances: Ollama Cloud quota drain; operators may not detect misuse (Insight #49: invocation looks identical to legitimate operator use). Signup-open instances: post-registration access to LLM configurations, system prompts, and conversation logs depending on platform.

### Integrity

Low at Lane-A verification depth. No write-tier probes performed.

### Availability

16 LLMjacking instances: quota exhaustion possible within Ollama Cloud plan windows. Academic research compute affected during exhaustion periods.

### Systemic Patterns

- The auth-on-default thesis is confirmed at population scale: 378/399 JupyterHub instances enforce auth. The exceptions (21 signup-open across all platforms) are the minority pattern, not the majority.
- `:cloud` suffix appears across 4 distinct institutional contexts (SDSC, RIT, UMaine, UCSB) — independent operators making the same `ollama signin` choice on shared-access research hardware. The class is systemic, not isolated.
- Public-deploy-without-firewall is structurally inherited from institutional networking (pre-LLM era posture extended without LLM-specific hardening).

---

## 7. Recommendations

### R1 — LLMjacking Class: Per-Institution Disclosure

Coordinate disclosure to the 16 institutions with LLMjacking-class instances. Recommended message: firewall port 11434 from external routing OR run `ollama signout`. CC Ollama upstream for ecosystem-level fix request (startup warning when `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` + `ollama signin` both active).

### R2 — Signup-Open Class: Per-Platform Default Fix

Each platform operator needs `SIGNUP_DISABLED=true` or equivalent in their deployment config. Per platform:

```bash
# Open WebUI:
ENABLE_SIGNUP=false

# Dify:
# DIFY_INVITE_ONLY=true (or restrict via admin panel)
```

### R3 — Lane B Completion

Resume via `~/recon/global-university-llm-map/STATE.md`. Remaining: ~8,000 institutions. Expected completion time given checkpointed pace: several hours at 1.2s/query rate.

### R4 — Globe Maintenance

After Lane B completes: rebuild `findings.json` → re-run geo-enrich → rebuild public feed → push to portfolio. Globe auto-updates on portfolio deploy (OSINT submodule pull).

### Future Automation

```bash
# Resume Lane B from checkpoint:
python3 institution-sweep.py \
  --dataset world_universities_and_domains.json \
  --state STATE.md \
  --resume \
  --rate 1.2
```

## 8. Limitations and Assumptions

| # | Limitation | Risk Implication |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Lane B incomplete (~2,200/10,224 at session end) | Non-academic-TLD universities not yet counted; finding totals will increase |
| L2 | Lane C (bare-IP netblock) not built | University-allocated IP ranges not covered; some deployments will be missed entirely |
| L3 | Hipo dataset coverage: 10,224 institutions | Dataset may not include all active universities; completeness unknown |
| L4 | Public feed anonymized to lat/lon ±38km | City-level precision only; globe cannot be used for per-campus targeting (by design) |
| L5 | verify.py applies marker probes only; deep-enum deferred | Exposure depth (data content, chain potential) not assessed at Lane A/B scale |
| L6 | Analysis reconstructed from session notes (SESSION.md). Execution trace timestamps are approximate. | |

## 9. Proof of Concept (PoC) Illustrations

### PoC 1: Academic-TLD LLMjacking Surface Identification

**Scenario:** Pipeline identifies LLMjacking-class instance at international academic institution without invoking any cloud model.

```
REQUEST (verify.py marker probe):
  GET http://<academic-host>:11434/api/tags HTTP/1.1
  Host: <academic-host>:11434

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "models": [
      {"name": "kimi-k2.6:cloud", "size": 0},
      {"name": "deepseek-v4-pro:cloud", "size": 0},
      {"name": "gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud", "size": 0}
    ]
  }
```

**Demonstrated:** `:cloud`-suffix model entries confirm Ollama Cloud signin state. Any caller can POST to `/api/chat` with these model names and consume the operator's quota. What this does NOT do: invoke any model, consume any quota, or interact with the Ollama Cloud infrastructure. Marker probe only.

### PoC 2: Anonymized Globe Feed Record

**Scenario:** Public globe feed record showing exposure class without operator-identifying data.

```json
{
  "lat": 43.XX,
  "lon": -76.XX,
  "country": "US",
  "exposure_class": "llmjacking",
  "platform": "ollama",
  "count": 1
}
```

**Demonstrated:** Lat/lon jittered ±38km from actual campus. No institution name, no IP, no hostname. Exposure class and platform visible for research transparency. Adversary cannot use this feed to locate a specific target — city-level granularity only.
