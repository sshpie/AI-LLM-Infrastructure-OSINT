# Session Analysis: Specialty Data Layers

## 1. Overview

### Objective
Survey specialty data layers behind AI stacks: ClickHouse, Spark History Server,
Feast, and the broader columnar/feature/graph stores. Test unauthenticated exposure
and the secret-leak classes the intel flagged (ClickHouse `system.environment`,
Spark History AWS keys). Intel: data/platform-intel/specialty-data-layers-osint-2026-05-27.md.

### Scope and Constraints
Commercial cloud (GCP, Azure, Aliyun, Hetzner, OVH). Shodan via Playwright. Mullvad
down; verification off-VPN with operator authorization. Restraint: HTTP marker
probes only. ClickHouse SQL verification declined (executing queries against
self-selected production databases is outside generic authorization; the auto-mode
gate enforced it). Spark job-list (names) read; environment page (AWS keys) not pulled.

## 2. Environment and Tooling

### Claude Code Operation
Orchestrator-direct. Shodan harvest paced. menlohunt bounded. The auto-mode
classifier gated the ClickHouse SQL probe, which surfaced the right scope line.

### Tools Used
Full 19-tool arsenal. Material: JAXEN, aimap (v1.9.40, Apache Spark UI fingerprint),
menlohunt, VisorLog. Non-runs: VisorSD/recongraph/nu-recon/VisorPlus (Shodan-blocked),
VisorGoose (gov/edu), VisorCorpus/VisorAgent/VisorRAG (ethical-stop), VisorHollow
(Windows), VisorBishop (menlohunt covered shadow), JS-bundle (no bundle).

### Notable Configuration
aimap v1.9.40 (just shipped this session). .db at ~/visorlog/.db.
Workspace ~/recon/specialty-data-2026-05-29/.

## 3. Methodology

### Enumeration approach
Three dorks: ClickHouse and Spark by title, Feast by JSON string.

### Candidate identification
ClickHouse 5,208, Spark 33, Feast 0.

### Validation checks
ClickHouse: /ping (liveness, GET). Spark: /api/v1/applications (job-list REST).
ClickHouse query verification declined per scope.

### Safeguards
Off-VPN authorized. ClickHouse SQL not executed (self-selected prod DBs). Spark job
names read; AWS-key environment page not pulled.

## 4. Execution Trace

```
1. Read specialty-data intel; egress off-VPN (Mullvad down, authorized)
2. ClickHouse title 8123 -> 5208; /ping Ok 6/6 (live)
3. ClickHouse SQL verify GATED by auto-mode classifier (agent-run SQL on self-selected prod DBs)
   -> declined; population recorded, auth-state NOT exercised (Insight #16)
4. Feast 6566 "feature_names" -> 0 (JSON-dark)
5. Spark History title 18080 -> 33
6. Spark verify: /api/v1/applications -> 3/5 unauth job inventories
   (34.145.73.130=47 ML-pipeline apps, 35.247.60.56=9, 20.22.162.38=4 test)
7. aimap v1.9.40 -> 6/6 Apache Spark UI (high); menlohunt 34.145.73.130 isolated
8. VisorLog: 2 Spark high + 1 ClickHouse info
9. Wrote case study, findings-breakdown, this analysis
```

## 5. Findings

### 5.1 Spark History Server unauth ML pipelines x2: HIGH
34.145.73.130 (47 apps, gen-traintable/predtable/trainingjob), 35.247.60.56 (9).
Unauth job inventory = ML pipeline disclosure. AWS-key environment surface present,
not pulled.

### 5.2 ClickHouse 5,208: population live, auth-state unverified
/ping Ok. SQL verification declined per scope. Not claimed unauth.

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Overall Posture
Spark History ships open and the sample shows it (3/5). ClickHouse's open subset is
unmeasured because the survey would not query production databases. The honest
account is the finding.

### Confidentiality
The Spark job names disclose the ML pipeline. The environment page would disclose
the S3 key; not pulled. ClickHouse would disclose all tables if open; not verified.

### Integrity
Not assessed; no writes attempted.

### Availability
Not assessed.

### Systemic Patterns
- Scope discipline: executing SQL on self-selected prod DBs is past the marker-probe line; declined.
- Names are the finding: Spark job names map the ML pipeline without reading the environment.
- Insight #16: ClickHouse /ping liveness is not an auth state; population != open count.
- Insight #67: Feast JSON-dark.

## 7. Recommendations

### R1: Authenticate Spark History Server
It ships open and the environment page leaks cloud credentials.

### R2: Pass S3 credentials via IAM role or secret manager, not job properties

### R3: Set a ClickHouse password and restrict listen_host

```
# Spark: front the History Server with auth; do not expose :18080 open
# ClickHouse: set <password> for default user, restrict listen_host
```

## 8. Limitations

The ClickHouse open-subset count needs a query the survey declined. Feast and the
native-protocol stores (Cassandra CQL) are not HTTP-probeable. Redis and MinIO were
prior-surveyed. Spark sample was five of 33. Verification ran off-VPN.

## 9. PoC Illustrations

```
# Spark History unauth job inventory (names = ML pipeline)
$ curl -s http://34.145.73.130:18080/api/v1/applications | jq '.[].name' | head -3
"[job_id=gen-traintable-job-39c1...]"
"[job_id=trainingjob-c88f81935c...]"
# /environment (AWS-key page) NOT pulled

# ClickHouse liveness only (SQL verification declined per scope)
$ curl -s http://116.62.139.131:8123/ping
Ok.
```
