# Session Analysis: Agent-Memory Pre-Assessment and the Verification-Rung Grid

**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Session:** date-only (methodology-formalization arc)
**Classification:** Internal / Research Use Only
**Toolchain:** parallel OSINT research agents (Opus subagents), WebFetch, Go 1.26 (logic-reproduction harness), Docker (present, not used this session)
**Repos updated:** AI-LLM-Infrastructure-OSINT (uncommitted at write time); `~/.claude/-internal/METHODOLOGY.md` (local canon)

## 1. Overview

### Objective

Open the next unmapped niche category, the agent-memory layer (mem0, Letta,
Zep, and adjacent self-hostable memory servers), at the pre-assessment stage. The
thesis question: does the auth-on-default thesis hold on a platform class whose
entire purpose is persisting PII-dense user memory? Secondary objective, which
became the session's main product: formalize the claims-discipline vocabulary
that the program had been applying informally, into a reusable verification-rung
grid.

This session was deliberately held at high depth, low breadth. No public host was
scanned. The survey's harvest and arsenal phases were not run, by choice (
restraint ethic).

### Scope and Constraints

- **Target class:** agent-memory / LLM long-term-memory self-hosted servers.
- **Allowed techniques this session:** public primary-source OSINT (official docs,
  GitHub source, CVE databases) via research subagents; local Go logic
  reproduction. No live third-party host touched.
- **Ethical limitations:** no data exfiltration, no destructive calls, no
  credential use, no scanning of public deployments. Breadth held at outer 0 by
  design.

## 2. Environment and Tooling

### Claude Code Operation

Orchestrator plus subagent delegation. Four Opus research subagents dispatched in
parallel for the pre-assessment OSINT (one per platform: mem0, Letta, Zep, plus an
ecosystem-sweep lane). Synthesis, verification decisions, and all writing kept at
the orchestrator. Opus-direct for the survey-relevant reasoning per standing
preference.

### Tools Used

| Tool | Role | Config notes |
|---|---|---|
| Research subagents (Opus) | Stage -1 pre-assessment OSINT, parallel fan-out | 4 lanes, primary-source-only brief |
| WebFetch | Pull verbatim Zep CE middleware source | raw.githubusercontent.com |
| Go 1.26 | Inner-A logic-reproduction harness | `/tmp/zep-auth-verify/main.go` |
| Docker 29.5.2 | Present and daemon up; not used this session (breadth held at 0) | available for inner-B step |

The 19-tool arsenal was not run. This is not a category-survey session; it is a
pre-assessment plus methodology-formalization session. The harvest (JAXEN /
Playwright Shodan), aimap fingerprinting, and the rest of the chain are queued
for whenever breadth is raised.

### Notable Configuration

Shodan API keys remain dead (carry-forward), so any future harvest is
Playwright-web-UI-only. Mullvad active (us-lax-wg-007). The pre-assessment lanes
need only public web access, so the dead keys did not constrain this session.

---

## 3. Methodology

### Enumeration approach

New-category pre-assessment per methodology Stage -1. Before any dork, four
parallel research agents gathered auth posture, ports, API surface, data-exposure
class, CVEs, and Shodan-fingerprint signals from primary sources. Output committed
to `data/platform-intel/agent-memory-osint-2026-05-29.md` and a query catalog to
`shodan/queries/30-agent-memory.md`.

### Candidate identification

The category's structural hazard: four of five in-scope servers default to port
8000. Fingerprints were designed to anchor on vendor-unique signals (OpenAPI
`info.title`, semantic routes like `/api/v1/cognify`, the `X-Zep-Version` response
header), never the port (Insight #7, Insight #15).

### Validation checks

One finding was driven to its rung this session: the Zep CE empty-`api_secret`
condition. Verbatim source pulled and read (Insight #11, source is authoritative).
The exact branch logic was reproduced in a Go harness and exercised against a
truth table, confirming the empty-token-passes behavior and the load-bearing
trailing-space precondition.

### Safeguards

No brute forcing, no privilege escalation, no data exfiltration, no credential
use, no scanning. The session's defining restraint decision: confirm the Zep
condition at the code level and stop, holding breadth at outer 0 rather than
standing up a container (inner B) or scanning the public CE population (outer
1/2). This is " mode" exercised on purpose.

## 4. Execution Trace

| Time | Action | Outcome / Decision |
|---|---|---|
| 16:13 | Session start, methodology loaded, continuity read | Loop next-category was ML Governance; Nick redirected to niche/smaller platforms |
| 16:20 | Coverage gap map vs FUTURE-SURVEYS roadmap | Identified agent-memory as freshest unmapped niche; Nick selected it |
| 16:30 | 4 parallel Opus OSINT lanes dispatched | mem0/Letta/Zep + ecosystem briefs returned, all primary-sourced |
| 16:45 | Synthesized intel doc + cat-30 query catalog | Committed-to-disk pre-assessment artifact |
| 16:55 | Zep CE middleware source pulled (WebFetch) | Confirmed verbatim `strings.Split` + equality compare |
| 17:00 | Go logic-reproduction harness run | Truth table confirms empty-secret + `Api-Key ` = allow; trailing space load-bearing |
| 17:10 | Iterative methodology dialog with Nick | Linear ladder rejected in favor of 2D Depth x Breadth grid |
| 17:30 | Insight #68 + canon box + template + finding written, then retrofitted to grid | All artifacts consistent on inner(A/B) x outer(0/1/2); restraint ethic named |

## 5. Findings

> Severity policy: every tier label requires 100% verified evidence at that tier.

### 5.1 Zep Community Edition — empty default `api_secret` accepts a zero-entropy credential

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | Zep CE secret-key auth middleware |
| **Type** | Authorization control (header check) |
| **Evidence** | Verbatim source (`legacy/src/api/middleware/secret_key_auth_ce.go`): `strings.Split(authHeader," ")`, prefix gate `Api-Key`, `tokenString != config.ApiSecret()`. `legacy/zep.yaml` ships `api_secret` empty. Logic reproduction confirms `Authorization: Api-Key ` (trailing space) passes when secret is empty. |
| **Observed exposure** | Zero-entropy credential satisfies the auth check on default config; no non-empty-secret invariant at config load |
| **Severity** | OBSERVED (code-level). Inner A / outer 0. Not labeled exploitable: no live binary exercised, no host surveyed. |

**Potential impact (code level):** on a populated instance the gated `/api/v2`
surface serves session message history, summaries, and extracted user facts
(PII-dense conversational memory). Impact is stated at code level only because the
finding has not been exercised against a running binary or any real deployment.

**No other findings.** No population survey was run, by design.

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Overall Posture

Category-level, the agent-memory tier reads as a strong auth-on-default thesis
confirmation at the source level: of the in-scope platforms, OpenMemory (mem0
legacy), Letta, Zep CE, Cognee, Graphiti, and Motorhead all read as auth-off or
default-cred by default; only mem0's newer `/server` ships auth-on. That single
counter-pressure case is Insight #40 (auth-on-default shifts rightward) playing
out inside one repository, the deprecated component auth-off and its replacement
auth-on. None of this is measured. It is inner A / outer 0: supported by code
reading, not by population data.

### Confidentiality

If exposed and exercised, the data class is high: conversation-derived user facts,
session message history, system prompts, and LLM provider config (potential key
leak via mem0 `/api/v1/config`). The data sensitivity is the reason this category
is worth surveying and the reason verification discipline matters before any
public claim.

### Integrity

mem0 OpenMemory supports unauthenticated writes (POST `/api/v1/memories`), a
memory-poisoning vector at code level. Not exercised.

### Availability

Not assessed.

### Systemic Patterns

Platform-default propagation (Insight #13) is the expected driver, to be tested
when breadth is raised. The port-8000 clustering is an operator-and-ecosystem
pattern that shapes the discovery method, not a risk in itself.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### R1 — Zep CE: reject an empty secret at config load

```yaml
# zep.yaml — operator fix
auth:
  required: true
  secret: "<non-empty-random-value>"   # ZEP_AUTH_SECRET
```

For the project: refuse to boot, or treat the route as deny-all, when the
configured secret is empty. This removes the entire zero-entropy-credential class
rather than depending on each operator to set a value.

### R2 — Category fingerprinting: anchor on protocol features, never port 8000

Fingerprints for this category must key on OpenAPI `info.title`, the unique route
set, or a vendor header (`X-Zep-Version`, the `m0sk_` key prefix). A port-8000
plus generic Swagger match would inherit the substring-FP class (Insight #7).

### Future automation

When breadth is raised, the masscan-seeded path is likely required (these servers
are probably Shodan-dark behind JSON-only roots, like the embedding tier):

```bash
# masscan tier-2 cloud on the agent-memory port set, then aimap by API shape
sudo masscan -iL /tmp/tier2-all-ranges.txt -p8765,8283,8019,8000,9000,6333 --rate 10000 -oG /tmp/agent-memory.txt
aimap -list /tmp/agent-memory-ips.txt -o agent-memory.json
```

## 8. Limitations and Assumptions

| # | Limitation | Risk Implication |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | No live host tested (outer 0 by design) | Cannot speak to prevalence; thesis confirmation is source-level only |
| L2 | Zep bypass is inner A (logic reproduction), not inner B (binary) | "Exploitable" not licensed until a CE container is exercised |
| L3 | Auth-default claims for ecosystem platforms are doc-inferred | Each must be exercised before any tier label |
| L4 | No aimap fingerprint exists for any platform yet | Unknown FP rate until fingerprints are built and sample-200 validated |
| L5 | Shodan API keys dead | Any harvest is Playwright-web-UI-only; likely Shodan-dark, masscan-seeded |

---

## 9. Proof of Concept (PoC) Illustrations

> Read-only / simulated. No operator data, no credentials, no live host.

### PoC 1: Zep CE empty-secret logic (inner A, against a local harness, not a host)

**Scenario:** demonstrate, against a reproduction of the released auth logic, that
an empty configured secret accepts an empty-token credential.

```
HARNESS (reproduction of secret_key_auth_ce.go branch logic):
  authOK("Api-Key ", "")          -> true   (BYPASS: empty secret + empty token)
  authOK("Api-Key", "")           -> false  (no trailing space: 1 part, 401)
  authOK("Api-Key ", "s3cr3t")    -> false  (set secret rejects empty token)
  authOK("Api-Key s3cr3t","s3cr3t") -> true (control: correct token)
```

**Demonstrated:** the branch logic accepts a zero-entropy token when the secret is
empty, and the trailing space is load-bearing. It does NOT demonstrate the
released `zepai/zep` binary behaves identically in a full stack (that is inner B),
nor that any real deployment is exposed (that is outer 1+). The boundary is the
point.
