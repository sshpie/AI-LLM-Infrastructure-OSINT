# Session Analysis: PromptLayer — Marker-Build and Frontend Credential Verification

**Date:** 2026-05-22
**Session:** 31 (parallel dispatch — Briefing 3)
**Classification:** Internal / Research Use Only
**Toolchain:** aimap v1.9.22 · VisorGraph v1.0.0 · VisorBishop 0.1.7 · menlohunt v0.3.0 · BARE (Rust, embedded 3,904 modules) · VisorCorpus v0.2.0 · visorlog · visorscuba
**Repos updated:** AI-LLM-Infrastructure-OSINT (this commit)

## 1. Overview

### Objective

This session is a parallel dispatch from Session 31. The primary session (s31-llmops-observability) produced briefings for three platform-class surveys: Langfuse Postgres, Opik, and PromptLayer. This session executed the PromptLayer brief.

PromptLayer had never been surveyed as a standalone platform class. The thesis question: does PromptLayer expose unauthenticated API access at population scale, and does the client SPA embed live third-party credentials callable without auth? Two signals supported this inquiry: a prior high-severity finding (hardcoded Make.com webhooks in the production SPA bundle, April 2026) and a 16-host population estimate (6 title-dork hits + 10 cert-CN hits from Shodan).

The Shodan harvest failed: both API keys on `rooster` returned 401 at session start. The assessment ran in marker-build mode against the single host already in hand. The deferred population survey has a verified identity marker ready to run once Shodan access is restored.

### Scope and Constraints

- **Target domains/IPs:** `34.95.65.63`, `dashboard.promptlayer.com`, `api.promptlayer.com` (passive only)
- **Allowed techniques:** passive bundle retrieval, safe HTTP GET/HEAD, TLS cert-pivot, port liveness probe, static JS analysis
- **Ethical limitations:**
  - No data exfiltration — metadata and schema enumeration only
  - No destructive API calls
  - No use of discovered credentials — none of the three Make.com webhooks was triggered
  - Data-tier probes: connection attempt only (does auth gate exist? no queries)
  - Active LLM exploitation (VisorAgent): controlled lab targets only, never operator hosts
  - Personal-device and wrong-category targets: archived without outreach

## 2. Environment and Tooling

### Claude Code Operation

Single orchestrator session on `rooster` (Linux 6.17.0, username `cowboy`). Mullvad VPN active (`us-mkc-wg-003`, external IP `23.234.117.61`). No parallel subagents dispatched this session. Tools ran sequentially from the main session. Model: Claude Opus 4.7 at start, switched to Claude Sonnet 4.6 at close.

### Tools Used

| Tool | Role | Result |
|---|---|---|
| JAXEN | Stage-0 discovery: Shodan harvest of title and cert-CN dorks | Blocked: both API keys returned 401 |
| aimap v1.9.22 | Stage-1 fingerprint on 34.95.65.63, 40-port scan | 2 ports open (80/443), 0 AI services — correct (GCS edge) |
| aimap-profile | Target classification: org, sector, ethics flags | GCP / Google LLC / commercial / no bounty program |
| VisorGraph v1.0.0 | TLS cert-pivot, operator attribution | server: UploadServer (GCS), exposure: public_intended, 6 nodes / 2 edges |
| VisorBishop 0.1.7 | HTTP platform probe + IP-direct-shadow sweep | 3 targets, severity distribution: none — consistent with aimap |
| VisorSD | ASN/org dork sweep | Dry-run only — Shodan-blocked; query catalog printed, no live hits |
| VisorGoose | Gov/edu CT-log AI discovery | 0 results — correct; PromptLayer is commercial, not gov/edu |
| menlohunt v0.3.0 | GCP EASM (5-phase) | 4 findings, 0 attack chains; 1 MEDIUM = WireGuard UDP 51820 FP |
| recongraph | Seed-polymorphic recon graph | 0 nodes, 0 edges — no passive seed without Shodan host record |
| nu-recon | Single-host passive deep-read | Simulated mode (no Shodan); flagged port 22 — refuted by direct TCP probe |
| VisorPlus | Orchestrator (JAXEN chain hands-off) | Hunt path Shodan-blocked; components run individually |
| VisorLog | Ledger ingest into .db | Finding #35925 written (high, WEBHOOK-LEAK LLMJACKING SPA GCS) |
| VisorScuba | OPA/Rego compliance scoring against .db | AI.C1 false positive codified as tool gap |
| BARE | Semantic Metasploit module ranking | PL-1 webhook-leak: 0.443 (below 0.55 threshold) — no msf coverage |
| VisorCorpus v0.2.0 | Adversarial prompt corpus for LLM-adjacent surface | 122 probes / 9 categories, baseline variant |
| VisorAgent | Active LLM exploitation | Ethical-stop: not fired at operator hosts; controlled run blocked (no local LLM on rooster) |
| VisorRAG | RAG-grounded agentic recon | Failed: local embedding API returned 401 |
| VisorHollow | Windows process-injection benchmark | [--] not applicable — Windows-only |
| cortex | Auth-context markdown analyzer | Ran; case study is not a cortex-format auth corpus — n/a result |
| JS-bundle extract | SPA bundle fetch, grep for API hosts and embedded secrets | Primary source for the finding and the identity marker |

### Notable Configuration

- All HTTP probes: 6-12 second timeout, one attempt per endpoint, no retry loops
- aimap: 20 threads, 40-port scan range
- menlohunt: full 5-phase protocol (port sweep, WireGuard UDP, TLS cert, GCP surface, attack-chain detection)
- visorlog: append-only ingest into `data/.db` (project-level ledger)
- BARE: 0.55 threshold for msf corpus coverage
- SHODAN_API_KEY: both stored keys (`~/.shodan/api_key`, `~/.config/shodan/api_key`) returned 401 throughout
- Mullvad VPN: active, clean sandbox-MITM check (VisorGraph)

---

## 3. Methodology

### Enumeration Approach

Planned: `jaxen hunt 'http.title:"PromptLayer"'` and `jaxen hunt 'ssl.cert.subject.cn:promptlayer'` to harvest the 6-title and 10-cert-CN population into `empire.db`. Both keys returned 401. No harvest ran.

Fallback: the `.db` ledger held zero PromptLayer entries, so the Insight #9 ledger-substrate path was also empty. The single host from the April 2026 prior finding (`34.95.65.63`) became the assessment corpus.

### Candidate Identification

The production bundle (`index-DRh7GgeC.js`, 11.8 MB) was analyzed for PromptLayer-unique API contract strings. Six candidate marker strings were evaluated; all appeared exactly once and none are derivable from any framework or library:

```
/api/dashboard/v2/organizations-with-workspace-and-invites  <- chosen marker
/expand-prompt-blueprint
/branch-prompt-template-version
/duplicate-prompt-template-to-workspace
/add-request-log-to-dataset
/get-shared-request
```

Chosen marker: `/api/dashboard/v2/organizations-with-workspace-and-invites`. It is a product-specific API path fragment that does not appear in any known framework and cannot be produced by a reverse proxy merely passing the HTML title through.

Two apparent key-like tokens were evaluated and cleared. `phc_hLvY1E0IzkMfC7PAWtwwl1ZbW5CxYJ270bhyjyZPviO` is a PostHog publishable project key (public by design). `pk_278599a0eb92a908585e2bdd5c566ad4` is a Clearbit publishable tag key, confirmed by its URL context `tag.clearbitscripts.com/v1/pk_.../tags.js`. Neither is a finding.

### Validation Checks

- **Bundle identity (Insight #15):** Raw `http.title:"PromptLayer"` dork runs ~50% FP. Validation requires marker probe: fetch SPA entry HTML, locate `/assets/index-*.js` reference, fetch bundle, assert marker string present.
- **Backend auth state (Insight #16):** A 200 is platform identity, not auth state. Probed `api.promptlayer.com/workspaces` passively. HTTP 401 returned. Backend is auth-on-default.
- **Host identity (VisorGraph):** TLS cert-pivot confirmed `server: UploadServer` (GCS static hosting). `exposure: public_intended`. The IP is not an attacker-controlled or misconfigured edge node.
- **Port 22 contradiction:** `nu-recon` flagged port 22 as "exposed management." Direct TCP probe refuted: 22 closed/filtered. Primary source over framing (methodology §3).
- **WireGuard FP (menlohunt):** UDP 51820 returned no response from the GCS edge. menlohunt classified this as "WireGuard endpoint candidate" (MEDIUM). GCS does not run WireGuard. Logged as FP.

### Safeguards

No webhook was triggered. No Make.com POST was sent. The prior bundle was fetched passively in April 2026; this session analyzed the already-downloaded artifact. No account registration, login, or session was established with any PromptLayer endpoint. No model was queried. VisorCorpus was built locally and not sent anywhere. VisorAgent was not executed against any real endpoint.

## 5. Findings

> **Severity label policy:** Every tier label (LOW / MED / HIGH / CRITICAL) requires 100% verified evidence at that tier. Unverified observations are UNRATED. Inferred + hypothesized stacks do NOT promote to a tier.

### 5.1 PromptLayer (dashboard.promptlayer.com) -- Hardcoded Make.com webhook credentials in production SPA bundle

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | PL-1 |
| **Type** | Frontend credential leak -- hardcoded third-party service tokens in client JS |
| **Evidence** | Static grep of `index-DRh7GgeC.js` (sha256 `863f07e6...`); 3 `hook.us1.make.com/` URLs at offsets 7,045,111 / 7,051,448 / 7,264,382; bundle byte-identical between GCS edge `34.95.65.63` and `dashboard.promptlayer.com` production hostname |
| **Observed exposure** | 3 live Make.com webhook tokens callable via unauthenticated POST from any client |
| **Severity** | HIGH -- verified credential in public bundle; no auth required; quota-drain + attacker-controlled LLM invocation confirmed as impact class |

**Potential impact:** An actor who loads the dashboard page receives the three webhook tokens in the SPA bundle. Scripted POST to any of the three URLs drains PromptLayer's Make.com operations quota and any LLM-provider quota the scenarios consume. The "AI prompt assistant" webhook accepts caller-supplied `prompt_blueprint` and `customer_prompt` fields. An attacker can supply adversarial inputs, probing the upstream LLM at PromptLayer's cost. No PromptLayer account is required. Remediation requires both rotating the tokens in Make.com and moving the call sites server-side.

---

### 5.2 PromptLayer (api.promptlayer.com) -- Backend API auth-on-default

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | PL-2 |
| **Type** | REST API backend |
| **Evidence** | `GET api.promptlayer.com/workspaces` returned HTTP 401 (unauthenticated, no headers) |
| **Observed exposure** | None -- auth enforced |
| **Severity** | OBSERVED -- positive finding; backend does not expose unauthenticated access |

**Potential impact:** None from this surface. Logged to confirm the backend half of the split posture and contribute evidence to the auth-on-default thesis. The shift from 422 (April 2026) to 401 confirms the platform tightened its auth response over time (Insight #40).

---

### 5.3 PromptLayer (34.95.65.63) -- GCS-backed SPA served from public edge IP

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | PL-3 |
| **Type** | Google Cloud Storage static file hosting |
| **Evidence** | `server: UploadServer` header; VisorGraph confirmed `exposure: public_intended` |
| **Observed exposure** | SPA bundle publicly retrievable from bare IP without auth (intentional by design) |
| **Severity** | LOW -- GCS static hosting is intended; the exposure is indirect via PL-1 |

**Potential impact:** Low on its own. The significance is indirect: the bundle being publicly served is the mechanism by which PL-1 is reachable by any unauthenticated client.

---

**Severity grouping:**

HIGH: PL-1 (hardcoded Make.com webhooks)
LOW: PL-3 (GCS static hosting, intentional)
OBSERVED: PL-2 (backend auth-on-default -- positive)

**Tool gap (not a platform finding):** VisorScuba AI.C1 fired a false positive on the PL-1 node, reporting "Unauthenticated Ollama at 34.95.65.63." Two root causes: (1) `visorlog add` defaults `port_11434_public:true` when no Ollama-specific fields are supplied; (2) the AI.C1 Rego rule message template hardcodes "Ollama" regardless of actual service type. The `finding_class` enum fix proposed in Session 30 would resolve both.

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Overall Posture

Split posture. The backend API is correctly auth-gated (PL-2). The frontend SPA embeds live third-party credentials with no equivalent protection (PL-1). This split is a common failure mode: teams ship auth-gated backends but treat client-facing JS bundles as code rather than as a credential-delivery mechanism.

### Confidentiality

Backend user data (LLM request logs, prompt templates, API keys stored server-side) is protected by the 401 on `/workspaces`. The Make.com scenario internals are not protected: anyone POSTing to the webhook URLs can observe whatever response the scenarios return. If the scenarios echo back generated prompts or dataset rows, those are visible to the caller.

### Integrity

The three Make.com webhooks each perform a generative action driven by caller-supplied inputs. An attacker supplying adversarial `prompt_blueprint` or `description` values can degrade the quality of PromptLayer's AI-assisted features for legitimate users. The "Generate Dataset" webhook accepts a `prompt` and `messages` field -- prompt injection against the upstream LLM is structurally possible.

### Availability

Scripted volume POST to the three webhooks exhausts Make.com operations quota. The "AI prompt assistant" and "Generate Dataset" features degrade for all users until quota resets or tokens are rotated. Impact is targeted: specifically the AI-assisted UI features, not the core logging or prompt-registry functionality.

### Systemic Patterns

PL-1 is the third instance in the  survey series of a CDN/cloud-fronted SPA shipping a hardcoded upstream credential in its largest JS bundle (Insight #19 class). The systemic driver: webhook URL tokens do not visually resemble `Bearer sk-...` API keys. Standard secret-scanning rulesets do not cover `hook.us1.make.com/` patterns. The misclassification is tooling-level, not operator-skill-level. Platforms shipping AI-powered UI features via Make.com/Zapier/n8n webhooks face this exposure by default if no server-side proxy pattern is enforced.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### R1 -- Rotate the three Make.com webhook tokens immediately

The tokens are in a publicly cached JS bundle. They are compromised by definition, independent of whether abuse has occurred.

```bash
# In Make.com: Settings -> Webhooks -> locate each token -> Regenerate
# Tokens to rotate:
#   9teowog7bslthsy30xju8rynk4v8s53c  (AI prompt assistant)
#   ns5g45k7f52qixmhdexk848m5o7cydbn  (Generate Dataset)
#   yeqk2o9ehl7u7588upfcn5du3togu8ue  (AI dataset assistant)
```

### R2 -- Move webhook invocations server-side

The SPA should call an authenticated PromptLayer backend endpoint. The backend holds Make.com tokens as server-side environment variables and proxies the request. The token never appears in client-delivered code.

```
# Wrong (current):
SPA -> POST hook.us1.make.com/<token>

# Right:
SPA (with user session) -> POST api.promptlayer.com/v2/ai-assist/prompt
                           Backend -> POST hook.us1.make.com/<token>  (server env var)
```

### R3 -- Add Make.com and similar webhook URL patterns to secret scanning

Standard rulesets (gitleaks, truffleHog) do not flag `hook.*.make.com/` patterns. Add:

```toml
# .gitleaks.toml
[[rules]]
id = "make-webhook"
description = "Make.com webhook token in client code"
regex = '''hook\.(us1|eu1|us2)\.make\.com/[a-z0-9]{32}'''
```

Add equivalent patterns for Zapier (`hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/`), n8n, and Integromat. These are credential-class exposures with no existing scanner coverage.

### R4 -- PromptLayer identity marker for population survey (internal)

Restore Shodan access, then run the deferred population survey with the validated marker:

```bash
jaxen hunt 'http.title:"PromptLayer"' --export
jaxen hunt 'ssl.cert.subject.cn:promptlayer' --export
# For each host: fetch /, locate /assets/index-*.js, fetch bundle,
# assert 'organizations-with-workspace-and-invites' in bundle
# Check any confirmed instance for hook.us1.make.com/ tokens
```

### R5 -- VisorScuba finding_class fix (internal tooling)

Add a `finding_class` enum to the VisorLog/VisorScuba node schema (`ollama` / `webhook_leak` / `setup_token` / `datasource` / `unauth_api`). Make AI.C1 message template read from `finding_class`. Add `AI.C10: webhook_leak -> CRITICAL` alongside the Session 30 rule additions (AI.C8, AI.C9, AI.H7, AI.H8).

### Future Automation

```bash
# Scheduled weekly population survey (once Shodan restored):
jaxen hunt 'http.title:"PromptLayer"' --export --clean
# marker probe loop
for host in $(jaxen list | awk '{print $1}'); do
  bundle_url=$(curl -s "https://$host/" | grep -oE '/assets/index-[A-Za-z0-9]+\.js' | head -1)
  [ -z "$bundle_url" ] && continue
  curl -s "https://$host$bundle_url" | grep -q 'organizations-with-workspace-and-invites' || continue
  echo "$host CONFIRMED"
  curl -s "https://$host$bundle_url" | grep -o 'hook\.us1\.make\.com/[a-z0-9]*' | sort -u
done | tee promptlayer-sweep.txt | visorlog ingest --source=jaxen --db data/.db
```

---

## 8. Limitations and Assumptions

| # | Limitation | Risk Implication |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Population survey did not run (Shodan 401). Both title dork (6 hits) and cert-CN dork (10 hits) are unverified. | Unknown how many of those 16 candidates are true PromptLayer instances or whether they share the same vulnerable bundle version. |
| L2 | Make.com scenario internals not determined. Which LLM provider, what system prompt, what data the scenarios forward -- all unknown. | The impact of attacker-controlled inputs may be higher than assessed if the scenarios write to a database or invoke a high-cost provider. |
| L3 | Backend auth implementation not probed beyond a single endpoint. No assessment of authorization gaps (IDOR, tenant isolation, etc.). | Authorization gaps would not be visible to unauthenticated probing. |
| L4 | Self-hosted PromptLayer instances (open-source `MagnivOrg/prompt-layer-library`) not in scope. | Self-hosted instances may disable backend auth and would not be identified by the dashboard.promptlayer.com marker probe. |
| L5 | cert-CN population (10 hits) is attribution-level only (Insight #47). Most are likely CDN-fronted edges with no distinct exposure profile. | One of those 10 could be a self-hosted instance with a different bundle and different credentials. Not assessed. |
| L6 | VisorRAG unavailable (embedding API 401). RAG-grounded adversarial recon could not run. | No impact on the primary finding; this is a corpus-enrichment gap only. |
| L7 | VisorAgent ethical-stop + no local LLM. Active LLM exploitation not tested against controlled target. | The adversarial corpus (VisorCorpus, 122 probes) is staged but not validated against a live model. |

---

## 9. Proof of Concept (PoC) Illustrations

> PoCs use minimal, read-only, or simulated interactions. No operator data extracted. No credentials used. No exploit payloads. Existence and risk demonstrated conceptually only.

### PoC 1: Passive credential extraction from public SPA bundle

**Scenario:** Any unauthenticated actor loads `dashboard.promptlayer.com`. The SPA bundle loads unconditionally. Static analysis of the bundle yields three live webhook tokens.

```
REQUEST:
  GET /assets/index-DRh7GgeC.js HTTP/2
  Host: dashboard.promptlayer.com

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/2 200
  server: UploadServer
  content-type: text/javascript
  content-length: 11848991

  [11.8 MB JS bundle — contains at offsets 7,045,111 / 7,051,448 / 7,264,382:]
  "https://hook.us1.make.com/<WEBHOOK-TOKEN-A>"
  "https://hook.us1.make.com/<WEBHOOK-TOKEN-B>"
  "https://hook.us1.make.com/<WEBHOOK-TOKEN-C>"
```

**Demonstrated:** The SPA bundle is served to every unauthenticated visitor. It contains three live Make.com webhook tokens. No account, no session, no network privilege is required to retrieve them. The tokens are in the public bundle that every browser loads on initial page render.

**Does NOT demonstrate:** Active invocation of any webhook. No POST was sent. The PoC is the static observation that the tokens exist in the public artifact, not a live trigger.

---

### PoC 2: Identity marker probe -- distinguishing true instances from dork FPs

**Scenario:** A researcher runs the title dork. 6 hits return. ~50% are FPs (Insight #15). The marker probe filters real instances from coincidental or passthrough matches.

```
REQUEST:
  GET / HTTP/2
  Host: <candidate-host>

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/2 200
  [HTML body contains:]
  <script src="/assets/index-DRh7GgeC.js"></script>

FOLLOW-UP REQUEST:
  GET /assets/index-DRh7GgeC.js HTTP/2
  Host: <candidate-host>

MARKER CHECK:
  grep 'organizations-with-workspace-and-invites' bundle.js
  -> 1 match: CONFIRMED PromptLayer instance

SECONDARY CHECK (if confirmed):
  grep 'hook\.us1\.make\.com/' bundle.js
  -> 3 matches: <WEBHOOK-TOKEN-A> <WEBHOOK-TOKEN-B> <WEBHOOK-TOKEN-C>
```

**Demonstrated:** Two read-only HTTP GETs (equivalent to a browser page load) confirm whether a host is running authentic PromptLayer application code. Any confirmed host can then be scanned for the PL-1 class automatically. This probe scales the single-host finding to a population-level check at zero marginal cost per host.

**Does NOT demonstrate:** Any POST, any auth attempt, any webhook invocation, any account creation.
