# Session Analysis: aimap Rasa Fingerprint Ship (v1.9.26)

**Date:** 2026-05-22
**Session:** 35
**Classification:** Internal / Research Use Only
**Toolchain:** aimap v1.9.26 (fingerprint + enumerator added this session)
**Repos updated:** aimap (1b64630)

---

## 1. Overview

### Objective

Close the tool gap identified in Session 34. aimap was blind to the entire Rasa
chatbot platform class: 98 confirmed open hosts, 0 detected. The session added
a three-conjunct Rasa fingerprint and a deep enumerator that sets auth_status and
surfaces the unauth webhook finding.

Thesis question: can the Session 34 tool gap be closed without a new Shodan pass?
Yes. The fingerprint is field-validated against 5 live hosts from the S34 corpus.

### Scope and Constraints

- **Target class:** aimap source (fingerprints.go, enumerators.go) — engineering only
- **Validation hosts:** 5 live hosts from S34 corpus (ODPC Kenya, LECO, HNBGI, Uludağ Elektrik, payment bot)
- **Allowed techniques:** GET / and POST /webhooks/rest/webhook (read-only) for fingerprint validation
- **Ethical limitations:**
  - No data exfiltration — metadata and schema enumeration only
  - No destructive API calls
  - No use of discovered credentials
  - Data-tier probes: connection attempt only (does auth gate exist? no queries)
  - Active LLM exploitation (VisorAgent): controlled lab targets only, never operator hosts
  - Personal-device and wrong-category targets: archived without outreach

## 2. Environment and Tooling

### Claude Code Operation

Single orchestrator session. Go source edit + build + validate cycle. No subagents.

### Tools Used

| Tool | Role | Result |
|---|---|---|
| aimap v1.9.26 | Target: added Rasa fingerprint + enumerator | Builds clean; fingerprint fires on 102.220.23.140:5005 |
| Direct HTTP (curl) | Field validation of fingerprint probes | Confirmed GET / banner, /status, /webhooks auth check |

### Notable Configuration

- VPN state: NO VPN (Google Fiber, Olathe KS)
- SHODAN_API_KEY: 401 — not used this session
- Build: `go build -o aimap .` — clean compile on first attempt after one type fix

---

## 3. Methodology

### Approach

Pattern: read existing fingerprint → extract probe schema → write new conjuncts → write enumerator → build → validate → commit.

Rasa's three-conjunct marker (Insight #6 discipline — minimum 3 conjuncts to avoid FPs at population scale):

1. `GET /` → `body_contains:"Hello from Rasa:"` — product-unique version banner; no framework or middleware emits this string
2. `GET /status` → `json_field:model_file` — Rasa-specific status schema
3. `GET /webhooks/rest/webhook` → `status_code:405` + `header_contains:Allow:GET` — confirms webhook endpoint exists without triggering a POST interaction

Enumerator chain:
1. Extract version from GET / banner
2. Extract model file path from GET /status (LOW finding: internal naming disclosed)
3. Auth probe: POST /webhooks/rest/webhook with `{"sender":"aimap-probe","message":"hello"}` — confirms `recipient_id` in response for Rasa ID, sets `auth_status: none` or `required`, adds HIGH finding on unauth webhook

### Validation

Field-validated against `102.220.23.140:5005` (ODPC Kenya, Rasa 3.5.10):
- service: Rasa, severity: high
- auth_status: none
- Findings: model file path (LOW), unauth webhook (HIGH), CORS wildcard (MED)

Zero false positives expected: the "Hello from Rasa:" banner is unique; no other platform in the aimap corpus uses this string.

### Safeguards

No brute forcing. No privilege escalation. No data exfiltration. Validation POST used the same minimal probe body as the S34 webhook survey.

## 4. Execution Trace

| Time | Action | Outcome / Decision |
|---|---|---|
| 18:42 | Located fingerprints.go insertion point (end of Fingerprints slice) | Inserted after Langfuse secrets entry |
| 18:43 | Wrote three-conjunct Rasa fingerprint | Severity: high; ports 5005, 80, 443, 8080 |
| 18:43 | `go build` | Build error: `non-boolean condition in if statement` — parseJSON returns (map, error) not (map, bool) |
| 18:43 | Fixed `if m, ok := parseJSON(...)` → `if m, parseErr := parseJSON(...)` | Clean build |
| 18:44 | Registered `"Rasa": enumRasa` in enumeratorRegistry | One-line registration per v1.9.19 pattern |
| 18:44 | `go build` | Clean |
| 18:45 | Validation run: `aimap -list /tmp/rasa_test.txt -ports 5005` | service: Rasa, severity: high, auth_status: none, HIGH finding confirmed |
| 18:45 | `cp aimap ~/go/bin/aimap` | Installed |
| 18:46 | `git commit` (fingerprints.go + enumerators.go) | b5be1cf |
| 18:46 | CHANGELOG.md: v1.9.26 entry added | Corrected version (v1.9.24 and v1.9.25 were already taken) |
| 18:47 | `git commit` + `git push` (CHANGELOG) | 1b64630 pushed |

## 5. Findings

No new host findings this session. Session produced a tool fix, not a new host survey.

**Tool gap closed: aimap now detects Rasa**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name/ID | TOOLFIX-AIMAP-RASA |
| Type | Tool gap closure |
| Evidence | aimap v1.9.26 detects Rasa on 102.220.23.140:5005 (verified); auth_status: none; HIGH finding on unauth webhook |
| Gap closed | S34 confirmed aimap saw 0 AI services on 98 open Rasa hosts; v1.9.26 closes this blind spot |
| Severity | OBSERVED (tool improvement, not a finding on operator infrastructure) |

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

No operator infrastructure assessed this session. The tool fix means future Rasa
surveys will produce findings in aimap output rather than silent no-detections.

The Session 34 risk picture stands: 50% of surveyed Rasa hosts are unauthenticated
by default. Government, utility, insurance, and payment operators are confirmed in
the exposed corpus.

---

## 7. Recommendations

**VisorBishop Rasa class** — still missing. VisorBishop exited without findings on
98 Rasa URLs in S34. Add a Rasa platform recognizer to VisorBishop's classifier.

**VisorScuba AI.C10** — webhook_unauth rule still not implemented (proposed S31,
unresolved). VisorScuba fires AI.C1 "Unauthenticated Ollama" on Rasa findings.
The fix requires a `finding_class` enum in the node schema.

**Rasa default configuration:**

```yaml
# credentials.yml — add this to require auth on the REST channel
rest:
  token: "<strong-random-token>"
```

Rasa maintainers should make token configuration mandatory before the REST channel
activates, or generate a random token at first run.

**Future automation:**

```bash
# With v1.9.26, Rasa is now detectable in CI
aimap -list corpus.txt -ports 5005 -o rasa_scan.json
visorlog ingest --from rasa_scan.json --format aimap-json
```

---

## 8. Limitations and Assumptions

| # | Limitation | Risk Implication |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fingerprint validated on 1 host (ODPC Kenya); true zero-FP rate unverified at population scale | Monitor for FPs on next full Rasa survey |
| 2 | Enumerator POST probe sends a message to the bot | Acceptable per methodology (minimal, read-only, same probe as S34 survey) |
| 3 | VisorBishop and VisorScuba gaps remain open | Rasa findings in those tools still inaccurate until patched |

---

## 9. Proof of Concept (PoC) Illustrations

### PoC 1 — aimap v1.9.26 Rasa detection

```
COMMAND:
  aimap -target 102.220.23.140 -ports 5005

OUTPUT (relevant fields):
  "services": [
    {
      "host": "102.220.23.140",
      "port": 5005,
      "service": "Rasa",
      "severity": "high"
    }
  ],
  "enum_results": [
    {
      "service": "Rasa",
      "auth_status": "none",
      "findings": [
        {"category": "unauth-access", "title": "Unauthenticated Rasa webhook — direct bot invocation", "severity": "high"},
        {"category": "info-leak",     "title": "Model file path exposed via /status", "severity": "low"}
      ]
    }
  ]
```

aimap detects Rasa, confirms no auth, surfaces the HIGH and LOW findings. Before
v1.9.26 this host returned 0 services detected.
