# Session Analysis: 4-Survey Batch

**Date:** 2026-05-16
**Session:** 15
**Classification:** Internal / Research Use Only
**Toolchain:** JAXEN · aimap v1.9.5→v1.9.6 · VisorLog · BARE · fast_enum_*.py (bespoke)
**Repos updated:** sshpie/AI-LLM-Infrastructure-OSINT (`3bd3901`) · sshpie/aimap (`be7cd8f`)

---

## 1. Overview

### Objective

Close four untouched or lightly-probed platform categories in a single continuous run. The thesis under test: do image-generation platforms (Tier-A, no auth concept) and data-labeling / agent-memory platforms (expected Tier-C, auth-on-default) diverge at population scale the way the model predicts? The vector-DB stragglers batch tests whether Solr, Meilisearch, Typesense, and Vespa sort cleanly into their expected tiers.

Four categories covered:
- Cat 08 — image-generation (ComfyUI / AUTOMATIC1111 / InvokeAI / Fooocus / SwarmUI)
- Cat 26 — agent-memory (Mem0 / Zep / Letta / Argilla)
- Cat 22 — data-labeling (Prodigy / Label Studio / CVAT / Doccano)
- Cat 02 stragglers — vector-DB (Solr / Meilisearch / Typesense / Vespa / pgvector)

### Scope and Constraints

- **Target domains/IPs:** Global public IP space. Shodan as the discovery layer. Platform-specific ports.
- **Allowed techniques:** Passive Shodan harvest, HTTP GET to documented API endpoints, banner grab, bespoke Python scripts (fast_enum_\*.py), aimap fingerprint probes.
- **Ethical limitations:**
  - No data exfiltration — metadata and schema enumeration only
  - No destructive API calls
  - No use of discovered credentials
  - Data-tier probes: connection attempt only (does auth gate exist? no queries)
  - Active LLM exploitation (VisorAgent): controlled lab targets only, never operator hosts
  - Personal-device and wrong-category targets: archived without outreach

---

## 2. Environment and Tooling

### Claude Code Operation

Single session. Orchestrator + bespoke Python scripts dispatched from the session. No subagent delegation. aimap v1.9.5 started the session; v1.9.6 shipped mid-session after the ComfyUI fingerprint was built and field-validated, then re-run against the corpus.

### Tools Used

| Tool | Role | Config notes |
|---|---|---|
| JAXEN | Stage-0 discovery: Shodan harvest → empire.db | Product-facet dorks per platform |
| aimap v1.9.5→v1.9.6 | Stage-1 fingerprint + Stage-2 verify | 5 new image-gen fingerprints shipped mid-session; v1.9.6 pushed before re-run |
| fast_enum_imagegen.py | ComfyUI mass-probe | threads=200, ~70 min, /system_stats endpoint |
| fast_enum_vectordb.py | Solr / Meilisearch / Typesense / Vespa mass-probe | Platform-specific endpoints per class |
| VisorLog | Ledger ingest → .db | 1,807 events ingested across 4 surveys |
| BARE | Metasploit semantic ranking | Solr 7.6.0 fleet: Velocity RCE top match (score 0.727) |
| VisorGraph | Cert-pivot → operator attribution | L40S fleet operator (103.192.253.237/.238) queued for future session |
| VisorAgent | Active LLM exploitation | Ethical-stop. Not run. |
| VisorHollow | Windows process-injection benchmark | Not applicable — Windows-only binary |

*Null results: VisorGraph queued but not run this session. VisorAgent and VisorHollow are non-run categories.*

### Notable Configuration

- SHODAN_API_KEY active. Harvest across all 4 categories completed before probing began.
- ComfyUI harvest capped at 50,058 candidates (22,178 unique IPs) — Shodan facet severely inflated by FPs, as measured during the session.
- Meilisearch, Typesense, Vespa, pgvector harvested separately from Solr to isolate per-platform denominators.
- Mullvad VPN state: not recorded in session notes; assumed active per standard operating posture.
- aimap `go test ./... clean` confirmed before v1.9.6 push.

---

## 3. Methodology

### Enumeration approach

Stage-0: JAXEN harvest using `product:"ComfyUI"` (Shodan facet) for image-gen; per-platform port-and-title dorks for agent-memory and data-labeling; `product:"Apache Solr"`, `product:"Meilisearch"`, `product:"Typesense"` for vector-DB stragglers. Total: 16,704 vector-DB candidates + 50,058 image-gen candidates + ~1,682 agent-memory and data-labeling candidates.

Stage-1: Bespoke fast_enum scripts at high thread count for mass-probe across large candidate lists. Platform-specific endpoints used for each class.

Stage-2: aimap v1.9.6 re-run after fingerprint validation. ComfyUI fingerprint field-validated on `103.192.253.238:8575` (NVIDIA L40S host) before scaling.

### Candidate identification

- **ComfyUI:** `GET /system_stats` returning JSON with `system.argv`, `system.os`, and `cuda` key. Four-conjunct anchor: status 200 + JSON shape + `system.argv` array + GPU key.
- **Solr:** `GET /solr/admin/info/system` returning XML with `<str name="solr-spec-version">` element.
- **Meilisearch:** `GET /health` returning `{"status":"available"}` plus `GET /indexes` returning array with `uid` keys.
- **Typesense:** `GET /health` returning `{"ok":true}` plus `GET /collections` requiring `X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY` header.
- **Mem0/Argilla:** Documented data-access endpoints probed with and without auth headers to verify gate state.

Insight #15 (dork hits vs platform instances) applied throughout: raw Shodan counts treated as candidates, not population. Verified-real counts quoted separately.

### Validation checks

- **Insight #6 (conjunctive markers):** Single-token dorks rejected; multi-conjunct probes used for all confirmations.
- **Insight #16 (status code is not auth state):** HTTP 200 at `/health` endpoint never treated as auth-state confirmation. Data-access endpoint probed separately.
- **Insight #26 (Shodan FP rate, codified this session):** ComfyUI `product:` facet measured at 97.3% FP rate. 48,500 of 50,058 candidates were unrelated services (Synology ISX1104, Fireware XTM, Qlik Sense, PRTG, NVR301). Verified-real count: 1,359 total ComfyUI (548 unauth + 811 auth-gated).
- **Insight #25 (Tier-C null results, codified this session):** Mem0 (0/45), Argilla (0/4), Typesense (0/9,837), Vespa (0/45) all produced 0% unauth. Published as positive thesis-evidence.

### Safeguards

No brute forcing. No privilege escalation. No data exfiltration. No document or row reads on any data tier. ComfyUI `GET /system_stats` reads operator-disclosed metadata (argv, GPU class), not user-generated content. Solr admin endpoints read configuration metadata, not index documents. Meilisearch index UIDs read from `/indexes` are schema-level, not document content. All write-tier operations absent. No credentials used.

## 5. Findings

> **Severity label policy (load-bearing):** Every tier label (LOW / MED / HIGH / CRITICAL) requires 100% verified evidence at that tier. Unverified observations are UNRATED. Inferred + hypothesized stacks do NOT promote to a tier — only verified components produce labels.

### [15.1] ComfyUI — 548 unauth instances, GPU fleet compute-theft surface

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | ComfyUI deployments globally; highest-impact: 103.192.253.237/.238 |
| **Type** | Image-generation API + workflow execution engine |
| **Evidence** | `GET /system_stats` returns system.argv, GPU class, VRAM config on all 548 hosts |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated access to full workflow submission API; operator GPU class + argv disclosed |
| **Severity** | HIGH (verified unauth at population scale; compute-theft surface confirmed) |

**Potential impact:** Any actor can submit ComfyUI workflows to 548 hosts and consume operator GPU compute without authentication. The L40S fleet at `103.192.253.237/.238` (10 × NVIDIA L40S across two adjacent IPs, ~$50K hardware) represents roughly $240/day in cloud-equivalent compute burn for an attacker running sustained workflows. Operator argv discloses `--enable-manager` on some hosts, confirming ComfyUI-Manager presence. ComfyUI-Manager install-from-URL is RCE-by-design when accessible without auth.

---

### [15.2] Apache Solr 7.6.0 — 516 unauth hosts, three commodity CVE chains

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | Apache Solr 7.6.0 (released December 2018); 516 of 613 total unauth Solr hosts |
| **Type** | Full-text search and indexing engine, admin API exposed |
| **Evidence** | `GET /solr/admin/info/system` returns `<str name="solr-spec-version">7.6.0</str>` on 516 hosts |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated admin API; version confirmed; BARE match to three published RCE modules |
| **Severity** | HIGH (verified unauth + version pinpointed + commodity exploit class confirmed via BARE) |

**Potential impact:** CVE-2019-17558 (Velocity Template SSTI → RCE), CVE-2019-0193 (DataImportHandler RCE), CVE-2019-12409 (JMX-RMI port 18983 default-open). All three have Metasploit modules; BARE ranks `exploits_multi_http_solr_velocity_rce` at 0.727. The 84% dominance of version 7.6.0 (516/613) indicates a Docker image-template phenomenon (Insight #27 candidate, codified following session): a single image tag deployed at scale in 2019 and never patched.

---

### [15.3] Meilisearch — 268 unauth hosts, index schema disclosed

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | Meilisearch instances globally; 268 confirmed unauth |
| **Type** | Full-text + hybrid search API |
| **Evidence** | `GET /indexes` returns array of index UIDs and attributes without auth on 268 hosts |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated access to index listing; UID names disclose application schema |
| **Severity** | MED (schema disclosure confirmed; data-read not performed per restraint ethic) |

**Potential impact:** Index UIDs disclose operator application domain: healthcare directories, travel booking engines, financial-advisor profiles, B2B company registries. An actor with unauth Meilisearch access can query index documents (not tested, per restraint), modify indexes, or delete indexes without authentication.

---

### [15.4] Tier-C confirmations — Mem0, Argilla, Typesense, Vespa, Label Studio, CVAT, Doccano

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | Multiple platforms: Mem0 (45 real instances), Argilla (4), Typesense (9,837 Shodan candidates), Vespa (45) |
| **Type** | Agent-memory, data-labeling, and vector-DB platforms |
| **Evidence** | 0 unauth across all platforms at verified-real population sizes; API-key or session gates confirmed present |
| **Observed exposure** | None — auth gates functioning as designed |
| **Severity** | OBSERVED (thesis-confirming null result; platforms ship auth-on-default and operators deploy accordingly) |

**Potential impact:** None observed. These platforms confirm the auth-on-default thesis: the 100x gap between Tier-A (~95-100% unauth) and Tier-C (~0% unauth) tracks framework defaults, not operator skill.

---

### [15.5] Prodigy — 16 unauth hosts (auth-free by design)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | Prodigy annotation tool; 16 confirmed unauth hosts |
| **Type** | Data-labeling annotation platform |
| **Evidence** | Prodigy serves annotation UI and API without any auth gate by design on confirmed 16 hosts |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated access to annotation projects; project names and annotation task content accessible |
| **Severity** | LOW (auth-free by design per Prodigy docs; no auth gate exists to circumvent; data classification not verified) |

**Potential impact:** Annotation datasets exposed. Content class not verified per restraint ethic. Operator intent to expose is ambiguous — Prodigy's design assumption is local or VPN-restricted use, not public internet.

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Overall Posture

1,445 net-new unauth hosts confirmed across 4 surveys. The pattern splits cleanly along Tier-A / Tier-C lines exactly as the thesis predicts. The 100x gap between Tier-A unauth rates and Tier-C rates is now confirmed across 10+ platforms.

### Confidentiality

ComfyUI hosts leak operator GPU configuration and workflow intent via argv. Solr 7.6.0 hosts expose full admin API including schema, configuration, and indexed documents (content not read per restraint). Meilisearch hosts expose index UIDs and attributes. Prodigy hosts expose annotation project content.

### Integrity

ComfyUI: any actor can submit workflows, potentially replacing outputs or corrupting pipelines. Solr 7.6.0: CVE-2019-17558 provides unauth RCE, meaning full system integrity is at risk on 516 hosts. Meilisearch: index deletion possible without auth.

### Availability

ComfyUI: GPU compute exhaustion via sustained workflow submission. Solr 7.6.0: RCE enables service disruption. Meilisearch: index wipe without auth.

### Systemic Patterns

- **Docker image-template phenomenon:** Solr 7.6.0's 84% single-version dominance (516/613) signals a single pulled image tag never patched. This pattern recurs in the evening session on ClickHouse (55%) and Elasticsearch (7.x EOL family). Codified as Insight #27 (following session).
- **Tier-A/Tier-C split:** Framework defaults determine population auth posture. Every Tier-C platform surveyed at meaningful population size lands at ~0% unauth. Every Tier-A platform surveyed lands at ~95-100% unauth. This is not a property of operators, it is a property of framework defaults (Insight #13 extended by Insight #25).

---

## 7. Recommendations

### R1 — ComfyUI: Enable authentication or restrict network access

```bash
# ComfyUI does not ship built-in auth; use a reverse proxy
# nginx example:
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    location / {
        auth_basic "ComfyUI";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8188;
    }
}
# Or restrict to loopback and use SSH tunnel:
python main.py --listen 127.0.0.1 --port 8188
```

ComfyUI-Manager should be disabled or removed on any publicly reachable host. `--enable-manager` on a public host is RCE-by-design.

### R2 — Solr 7.6.0: Upgrade and enable security.json auth

```bash
# Check current version:
curl http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/info/system | grep solr-spec-version
# Migrate to Solr 9.x and enable BasicAuth:
# Add security.json to $SOLR_HOME with authPlugin class and credentials
# Minimum: restrict /solr/admin/* to localhost in jetty-requestlog.xml
```

The 516-host fleet represents a single upstream image. Disclosure to Apache Solr project and Docker Hub maintainer of `solr:7.6.0` is the highest-leverage remediation vector.

### R3 — Meilisearch: Set master key at startup

```bash
# All Meilisearch deployments require a master key to gate the API:
meilisearch --master-key="<random-32-char-key>"
# Or in Docker:
docker run -e MEILI_MASTER_KEY="<key>" getmeili/meilisearch
```

### R4 — Future automation

```bash
# Integrate aimap v1.9.6 into post-deploy pipeline for AI/ML infra:
aimap -list public-ips.txt -ports 8188,8001,8983,7700 -o report.json
# BARE for Solr findings:
bare -input report.json -adapter nuclei -top 5
```

## 8. Limitations and Assumptions

| # | Limitation | Risk Implication |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Analysis reconstructed from session notes (SESSION.md). Execution trace timestamps are approximate. | Exact probe timing not recoverable; relative order preserved |
| L2 | ComfyUI FP rate (97.3%) means 48,500 probes wasted on unrelated services; some real ComfyUI behind these FPs may be miscounted | True positive count is a floor, not a ceiling |
| L3 | A1111 / Forge / SD.Next / Fooocus / SwarmUI are Shodan-dark; Gradio-on-7860 SPAs not covered by this survey | These platforms need masscan tier-2 on port 7860; population unknown |
| L4 | Meilisearch data-tier reads not performed; severity reflects schema disclosure only | Full data exposure extent not bounded |
| L5 | Solr 7.6.0 RCE chains confirmed via BARE semantic match; no exploitation attempted | Exploitation feasibility is theoretical at this stage; BARE match is not a working exploit |
| L6 | VisorGraph cert-pivot on L40S fleet (103.192.253.237/.238) queued but not run this session | Operator attribution incomplete for this finding |
| L7 | pgvector: TCP-only on 5432; no Shodan-marker path to enumeration | Population genuinely unknown; not a tooling gap |

---

## 9. Proof of Concept (PoC) Illustrations

### PoC 1: ComfyUI operator fingerprint via /system_stats

**Scenario:** Anonymous actor enumerates the GPU fleet of an operator running ComfyUI publicly.

```
REQUEST:
  GET /system_stats HTTP/1.1
  Host: 103.192.253.238:8575

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "system": {
      "os": "posix",
      "python_version": "3.11.x",
      "embedded_python": false,
      "argv": ["/app/main.py", "--port=8575", "--listen",
               "--use-sage-attention", "--force-cond-uncond"]
    },
    "devices": [{
      "name": "NVIDIA L40S",
      "vram_total": 48318201856,
      "torch_vram_total": 48318201856
    }]
  }
```

**Demonstrated:** The actor now knows: GPU model (L40S, data-center tier), VRAM (47.8 GB), operator deliberate public-listen flag (`--listen`), attention backend. This is enough to compute the operator's hourly GPU cost and plan sustained compute theft. Does NOT read user prompts, workflow history, or model outputs.

---

### PoC 2: Solr 7.6.0 version and admin API unauth access

**Scenario:** Anonymous actor confirms Solr version and admin API reachability on a target host.

```
REQUEST:
  GET /solr/admin/info/system HTTP/1.1
  Host: <solr-7.6.0-operator>:8983

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/xml; charset=UTF-8

  <response>
    <str name="solr-spec-version">7.6.0</str>
    <str name="lucene-spec-version">7.6.0</str>
    <str name="java.version">1.8.0_x</str>
    ...
  </response>
```

**Demonstrated:** Version confirmed as 7.6.0. Admin API reachable without authentication. This is the prerequisite check for CVE-2019-17558 (Velocity Template RCE). Does NOT execute any exploit payload.

---

### PoC 3: Meilisearch index listing without auth

**Scenario:** Anonymous actor enumerates application schema from an unauth Meilisearch instance.

```
REQUEST:
  GET /indexes HTTP/1.1
  Host: <meilisearch-operator>:7700

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "results": [
      {"uid": "healthcare-provider-directory", "primaryKey": "provider_id"},
      {"uid": "financial-advisor-profiles", "primaryKey": "advisor_id"},
      {"uid": "travel-booking-inventory", "primaryKey": "flight_id"}
    ]
  }
```

**Demonstrated:** Index UIDs disclose the operator's application domain (healthcare, finance, travel) without authentication. An actor now knows what data classes the operator holds and can proceed to query those indexes. Does NOT read document content.
