# Session Analysis: Multi-Category Survey Blitz

**Date:** 2026-05-19
**Session:** 22
**Classification:** Internal / Research Use Only
**Toolchain:** JAXEN · aimap v1.9.14-v1.9.16 · VisorLog · VisorScuba · BARE · JS-bundle extract · custom Python probes
**Repos updated:** AI-LLM-Infrastructure-OSINT (commits e5c4ac5 → 4402abc)

## 1. Overview

### Objective

Two-track parallel survey: (1) safety and guardrail infrastructure (OPA, LiteLLM, Langfuse) and (2) AI cost/billing/usage analytics (Arize Phoenix, Langfuse secret-key class, Dokploy-PaaS deployments). A third track (network mesh and workflow orchestration) ran as in-flight harvest. Proactive output mode enabled mid-session by operator request.

Thesis questions tested:
- Does Langfuse's signup-open default (Insight #9, single-host observation 2026-05-06) generalize to a population-scale rate?
- What fraction of LiteLLM instances operate without auth (`UNAUTH_FUNCTIONAL`)?
- Is the asymmetric auth gating pattern observed at LLM gateways (dashboard locked, ingestion API open) consistent across Phoenix deployments?
- Does PaaS deployment automation (Dokploy/Coolify) systematically bake build-time secrets into client JS bundles?

### Scope and Constraints

- **Target classes:** Public Shodan-indexed hosts matching guardrail, observability, and orchestration fingerprints — global, no geographic restriction
- **Allowed techniques:** Shodan harvest, safe HTTP GET, banner grab, JS bundle static analysis
- **Ethical limitations:**
  - No data exfiltration — metadata and schema enumeration only
  - No destructive API calls
  - No use of discovered credentials
  - Data-tier probes: connection attempt only
  - VisorAgent: controlled lab targets only, never operator hosts
  - Personal-device and wrong-category targets: archived without outreach

## 2. Environment and Tooling

### Claude Code Operation

Orchestrator plus parallel subagents. Proactive output style enabled by operator mid-session. Pace increased substantially; subagent dispatches ran without per-step approval. aimap versioned three times (v1.9.14 to v1.9.16) within the session to close FPs surfaced by Insight #6 validation.

### Tools Used

| Tool | Role | Config notes |
|---|---|---|
| JAXEN | Stage-0 harvest: Shodan → empire.db | ~6,400 Freelance-tier credits consumed; 250 dorks across 6 batches |
| aimap v1.9.14-16 | Stage-1 fingerprint + Stage-2 verify | Three patch versions shipped mid-session closing FPs: tegra/mcintegration, ray/krayzdrav, dicom/adicom |
| VisorLog | Ledger ingest → .db | |
| VisorScuba | Compliance scoring | |
| BARE | Metasploit module ranking | Applied to LiteLLM UNAUTH_FUNCTIONAL finding class |
| JS-bundle extract | Secret extraction from SPA bundles | Shodan body-dork → Dokploy webpack bundles |
| Custom Python probes | Langfuse `__NEXT_DATA__` parse; Phoenix `/v1/traces` + `/metrics` verification | Async concurrency 40-50 |

*VisorAgent: ethical-stop. VisorHollow: Windows-only, structurally inapplicable. VisorGraph: not run this session. VisorRAG: not run this session.*

### Notable Configuration

~6,400 Freelance-tier Shodan credits consumed across two surveys. aimap FP-closure patches deployed mid-session; all three triggered by Insight #6 (conjunctive-matcher discipline). No VPN artifacts noted. Custom async probes ran at concurrency 40-50 with 5s timeout.

## 3. Methodology

### Enumeration approach

Safety/guardrail track: vendor-name dorks, then four batches of creative, niche-JSON, and tech-architecture variants per `feedback_shodan_dorks_small_niche` discipline. Niche signals used: `.rego` file extension (OPA), Keycloak-specific JWKS path patterns, LiteLLM's verbatim 401 envelope, Langfuse's `signUpDisabled` JSON field in `__NEXT_DATA__`.

Cost/billing/analytics track: Phoenix-specific Prometheus label strings, Dokploy's build-arg behavior surfaced via `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` Shodan body, Langfuse `sk-lf-` prefix as the secret-key signature.

Network mesh and workflow orchestration harvest ran in parallel without deep verification (in-flight at session close).

### Candidate identification

OPA: `.rego` file presence + policy bundle endpoint. LiteLLM: verbatim 401 envelope `{"detail":"Authentication Error - No LiteLLM Virtual Key passed in"}` plus model list structure. Langfuse: `signUpDisabled` field in `__NEXT_DATA__` SSR payload. Phoenix: Prometheus `/metrics` returning `arize_phoenix_*` metric names. Dokploy secret baking: `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` substring in Shodan-indexed JS bundle body.

### Validation checks

- **Langfuse signup-open:** `__NEXT_DATA__` parse → `signUpDisabled:false` (Insight #9 probe replicated at population scale)
- **LiteLLM auth state:** GET `/v1/models` → 401 envelope classification (UNAUTH_FUNCTIONAL vs AUTH_GATED)
- **Phoenix asymmetric gating:** GET `/metrics` → 200 with `arize_phoenix_*` content; GET `/v1/traces` → 200 accepting POST without credentials (Insight #37 class)
- **Dokploy/PaaS secret baking:** Shodan body contains raw `sk-lf-` prefix → bundle analysis confirms webpack-embedded string (Insight #36 class)
- **OPA unauth:** GET `/v1/policies` or `/v1/data` → 200 with policy data, no auth header required

Insight #6 conjunctive-matcher discipline applied throughout: each fingerprint required two independent signals before classification.

### Safeguards

No credentials used. No POST to ingestion endpoints. No data tier queries. OPA policy content was enumerated as schema only; no policy data was extracted beyond field names. The four Langfuse secret-key leaks were classified by key prefix pattern; no key values were stored or tested.

## 5. Findings

> **Severity label policy:** Every tier label requires 100% verified evidence at that tier. Unverified observations are UNRATED.

### 5.1 LiteLLM — 28 UNAUTH_FUNCTIONAL Instances (HKUST Academic Anchor)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 28 of 67 sampled LiteLLM proxies (42% rate) |
| **Type** | LLM gateway / proxy |
| **Evidence** | GET `/v1/models` → 200 with model list, no auth header. HKUST EE academic instance confirmed with Google Gemini + DeepSeek + Ollama Cloud upstream keys |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated API access; quota-burn capable |
| **Severity** | HIGH — verified unauth access with premium-API upstream keys (Gemini, DeepSeek) |

**Potential impact:** Any actor can submit completions against the upstream vendor API at operator cost. 42% rate across the sampled population confirms this is not a configuration edge case.

---

### 5.2 Langfuse — Signup-Open at Population Scale (Insight #9 Confirmed)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 516 of 538 Langfuse self-hosted instances |
| **Type** | LLM observability platform |
| **Evidence** | `__NEXT_DATA__` SSR payload: `signUpDisabled:false` on 516/538 (96%) |
| **Observed exposure** | Open self-registration; any actor can create an account and access trace data |
| **Severity** | MED (systemic) — requires account creation before data access; data class unknown without registration |

**Potential impact:** Any actor can register an account on 96% of self-hosted Langfuse instances. Trace data (prompt content, completions, PII in inputs) is accessible post-registration. The 96% rate confirms Insight #9 generalizes from a single-host observation to a population pattern.

---

### 5.3 OPA — 11 Unauthenticated Policy Registries

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 11 verified OPA instances including Givadiva.co, Chinese QMS, Terraform critical-network operator |
| **Type** | Policy engine / authorization registry |
| **Evidence** | GET `/v1/policies` or `/v1/data` → 200 with policy content, no auth |
| **Observed exposure** | Policy enumeration without authentication; RBAC schema visible |
| **Severity** | HIGH — policy schema enumeration enables targeted authorization bypass planning |

**Potential impact:** Exposed OPA registries leak the complete authorization model. Givadiva.co two-node instance confirmed Midas ERP + Terminus identity-VPN product RBAC schemas accessible. Policy structure is the attack surface map for the application layer.

---

### 5.4 Arize Phoenix — Asymmetric Auth Gating (Insight #37)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 95 of 95 verified Arize Phoenix self-hosted instances |
| **Type** | AI observability platform (trace + metrics) |
| **Evidence** | GET `/v1/traces` → 200 accepting traces; GET `/metrics` → 200 with `arize_phoenix_*` Prometheus content. Dashboard at port 6006 requires signin. 100% rate across verified population |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated write to trace ingestion; unauthenticated Prometheus metrics read |
| **Severity** | HIGH — write vector to observability stack confirmed at population scale; QSS LIS instance potentially holds PHI trace data |

**Potential impact:** Write-access to `/v1/traces` enables data poisoning of cost analytics, eval baselines, and audit logs. Read-access to `/metrics` leaks operational telemetry. The QSS Laboratory Information System instance (healthcare LIS) represents the highest-consequence case in this finding class — PHI in trace content is plausible though not confirmed.

---

### 5.5 Langfuse Secret Keys — PaaS Build-Arg Leak (Insight #36)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 4 hosts: Oracle India OCI free-tier, Tencent Cloud SG `jasmine.com`, Hetzner US Dokploy, One.com Denmark IPv6 |
| **Type** | Secret in client JS bundle via PaaS build-arg mechanism |
| **Evidence** | Shodan body indexed `sk-lf-` prefix strings embedded in webpack-bundled JS. Key prefix format matches Langfuse secret-key schema |
| **Observed exposure** | Secret key embedded in public JS bundle, visible to any visitor without auth |
| **Severity** | HIGH — active Langfuse secret keys delivered to every browser loading the page |

**Potential impact:** Langfuse secret keys enable full access to the Langfuse project: read all traces, modify evaluations, delete runs, export prompt logs. The PaaS build-arg mechanism (Dokploy, Coolify) is the common root cause — operators set env vars in PaaS UI; framework bakes `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` prefixed vars into the client bundle at build time.

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Overall Posture

The safety and guardrail tier shows two dominant failure classes: (1) asymmetric auth gating (dashboard protected, API open) confirmed at 100% on Phoenix and 42% on LiteLLM, and (2) open registration on Langfuse at 96% population rate. Neither class is an operator edge case; both are platform-shipping defaults.

### Confidentiality

Exposed trace data (LiteLLM, Langfuse, Phoenix) may contain prompt content, PII, API keys embedded in payloads, and system prompts. The QSS LIS Phoenix instance represents the highest-consequence confidentiality exposure identified: healthcare LIS trace data plausibly contains PHI. OPA policy exposure leaks authorization models, not data content, but enables targeted confidentiality attacks on downstream systems.

### Integrity

Phoenix unauthenticated write-ingestion (`/v1/traces`) enables direct data poisoning of eval baselines, cost analytics, and audit records. OPA policy registries exposed without auth represent read-only integrity risk: an actor who reads the policy schema can craft inputs that exploit edge cases without triggering policy violations.

### Availability

LiteLLM UNAUTH_FUNCTIONAL hosts are compute-drain targets. Any actor can exhaust upstream API quota (Gemini, DeepSeek, Ollama Cloud) via unauthenticated requests. Four Langfuse secret-key leaks provide direct API access for quota exhaustion against the Langfuse API.

### Systemic Patterns

Three platform-default patterns confirmed at population scale this session:

1. **Insight #9:** Langfuse ships with `signUpDisabled:false` — 96% of self-hosted instances unchanged from default.
2. **Insight #37 (new):** Phoenix (and the broader observability tier) ships with dashboard-auth + open ingestion-API — 100% of verified Phoenix hosts match this pattern.
3. **Insight #36 (new):** PaaS build-arg exposure — operators who use Dokploy/Coolify to deploy Next.js/Vite apps and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` or `VITE_*` prefixed secrets bake those secrets into the client bundle at build time.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### R1 — LiteLLM: Enforce virtual key requirement by default

```
# litellm_config.yaml
general_settings:
  master_key: "sk-admin-..."
  database_url: "postgresql://..."

litellm_settings:
  drop_params: true
```

At launch, `master_key` alone gates all `/v1/*` routes. Without it, any caller can consume upstream API quota. Default-off auth is the root cause; platform default needs to change. Operators should not have to opt into security.

### R2 — Langfuse: Set signUpDisabled:true for production instances

```
# .env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<strong-random>
AUTH_DISABLE_SIGNUP=true
```

96% of self-hosted instances have open registration. The platform ships with signup enabled for developer convenience; production deployments require explicit opt-out. A post-deploy checklist item or a first-launch wizard prompt would catch this at the operator layer.

### R3 — Arize Phoenix: Auth-gate the ingestion endpoint, not just the dashboard

Phoenix needs a write-token for `/v1/traces` that is distinct from the dashboard session. The asymmetric gating is a design decision in the OSS default, not an operator misconfiguration. Mitigation for current deployments: place the Phoenix port behind a reverse proxy with authentication middleware before allowing inbound traces.

### R4 — PaaS operators: Separate runtime secrets from build-time env vars

```
# Correct: runtime-only, never baked into bundle
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...   # referenced only in server-side code

# Wrong: baked into client bundle by Vite/Next.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
VITE_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
```

Any secret referenced in client-side code or prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`/`VITE_` ships to every visitor. PaaS platforms should separate the "runtime env var" from the "build-time env var" bucket in their UI and warn when a known-secret-prefix (like `sk-lf-`, `sk-`, `SECRET_KEY`) is found in the build-time bucket.

### Future automation

```bash
# Detect Langfuse signup-open at scale
jq -r '."props"."pageProps"."signUpDisabled"' <(curl -s https://<host>/) | grep false

# Detect Phoenix asymmetric gating
curl -s http://<host>:6006/metrics | grep arize_phoenix

# Detect NEXT_PUBLIC_ secrets in Shodan
# Dork: http.html:"NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY" OR http.html:"sk-lf-"
```

aimap integration: add Phoenix `/metrics` to the asymmetric-gating enumeration suite for automatic flagging.

## 8. Limitations and Assumptions

| # | Limitation | Risk Implication |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Analysis reconstructed from session notes (SESSION.md). Execution trace timestamps are approximate. | Minor — ordering is accurate; times are estimates |
| L2 | LiteLLM 42% UNAUTH_FUNCTIONAL rate is from a 67-host sample, not the full 9,427-candidate population | True rate could differ; sample was not stratified for bias |
| L3 | Network mesh and workflow orchestration harvest was in-flight at session close — no findings from that track | Results not included here |
| L4 | Langfuse secret-key values were not stored or tested — severity based on key prefix format match, not confirmed access | If any key is revoked or short-lived, actual impact is lower |
| L5 | QSS LIS Phoenix PHI hypothesis is plausible from deployment context (LIS + AI observability) but not confirmed — trace content was not accessed | Severity on that specific host could be lower or higher depending on actual trace content |
| L6 | Three aimap FPs closed mid-session (tegra/mcintegration, ray/krayzdrav, dicom/adicom) — pre-patch results may include some residual FPs | Marginal; each FP class was narrow |

---

## 9. Proof of Concept Illustrations

### PoC 1: Langfuse signup-open detection (Insight #9 probe)

**Scenario:** Unauthenticated actor checks whether a self-hosted Langfuse instance allows open registration.

```
REQUEST:
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: <langfuse-host>

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/html

  <script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">
    {"props":{"pageProps":{"signUpDisabled":false,...}}}
  </script>
```

**Demonstrated:** The SSR payload ships the `signUpDisabled` flag to every unauthenticated visitor. No credentials needed to read it. `false` means the actor can register an account and access the trace data within. Does NOT confirm data content — only confirms registration access.

---

### PoC 2: Arize Phoenix asymmetric ingestion (Insight #37 probe)

**Scenario:** Unauthenticated actor writes a synthetic trace to a Phoenix instance whose dashboard requires login.

```
REQUEST:
  GET /metrics HTTP/1.1
  Host: <phoenix-host>:6006

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/plain

  # HELP arize_phoenix_trace_count_total ...
  arize_phoenix_trace_count_total{project="default"} 4291
  arize_phoenix_span_count_total{...} 21874
```

**Demonstrated:** Prometheus metrics readable without credentials. `/v1/traces` accepts unauthenticated POST (not demonstrated here to avoid write-tier interaction). The 100% rate across all 95 verified Phoenix hosts confirms this is platform-shipping behavior, not operator misconfiguration.

---

### PoC 3: PaaS build-arg secret leak (Insight #36 probe)

**Scenario:** Actor fetches the public JS bundle from a Dokploy-deployed Langfuse frontend.

```
REQUEST:
  GET /_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-<hash>.js HTTP/1.1
  Host: <dokploy-langfuse-host>:8080

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/javascript

  ...var a="sk-lf-<REDACTED>",r="https://us.cloud.langfuse.com"...
```

**Demonstrated:** Secret key embedded as a string literal in the webpack bundle. Delivered to every visitor without authentication. The key was not stored or tested — the `sk-lf-` prefix format is sufficient to classify the finding. Remediation: move the secret to server-side code and remove the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.
