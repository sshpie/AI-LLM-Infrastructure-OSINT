## 1. Overview

### Objective

Roadmap-driven survey of 6 platform classes not yet covered: MCP servers, LLM gateways/OpenAI-compat proxies, RAG frameworks, AI safety eval tooling, browser automation backends, and data labeling platforms. All probed cross-cloud (Scaleway, OVH, Linode/Akamai) across ~1,017 prefixes / ~6.33M IPs. Secondary objective: track remediation outcomes from the session-7 36-email batch and resolve the 4 dead-letter institutions.

### Scope and Constraints

- **Target domains/IPs:** ~1,017 cloud prefixes across Scaleway, OVH (192.168.x.x/Roubaix), Linode/Akamai ranges; ~6.33M IP addresses
- **Allowed techniques:** masscan SYN discovery, safe HTTP GET, JSON-RPC protocol handshake (MCP), max_tokens=1 inference probe (LLM gateways — read-only quota burn proof), -contact WHOIS/DNS/security.txt lookup
- **Ethical limitations:**
  - No data exfiltration — metadata and schema enumeration only
  - No destructive API calls
  - No use of discovered credentials
  - Data-tier probes: connection attempt only (does auth gate exist? no queries)
  - Active LLM exploitation (VisorAgent): controlled lab targets only, never operator hosts
  - Personal-device and wrong-category targets: archived without outreach
  - Inference probe (LLM gateways): one unauthenticated chat/completions call per host, max_tokens=1, no operator key strings extracted

---

## 2. Environment and Tooling

### Claude Code Operation

Orchestrator-driven with 4 parallel masscan lanes running simultaneously in background (surveys 3-6 while surveys 1-2 were being synthesized). Sequential probe scripts per survey. -contact.py dispatched for dead-letter contact resolution. send_drafts_api.py ran the follow-up disclosure batch.

### Tools Used

| Tool | Role | Config notes |
|---|---|---|
| masscan | Stage-0 discovery | Ports 3000/8000/8080/8888/4444/9222/1984/15500/3001/8001/9380/9621/6900 across ~1,017 prefixes |
| MCP JSON-RPC handshake | Stage-1 protocol filter | `initialize` + `tools/list` call sequence; strict handshake required before scoring hit |
| aimap | Stage-1 cross-check | Platform identification confirm on MCP and gateway hits |
| data/rag-framework-probe.py | Stage-1 RAG probe | 115K targets at partial run; 60+ confirmed |
| data/aisafety-probe.py | Stage-1 AI safety probe | Single-word substring matching (later found to produce 6 FP, 0 TP — see Session 9) |
| data/browser-agent-probe.py | Stage-1 browser agent probe | CDP endpoint detection |
| data/datalabel-probe.py | Stage-1 data labeling probe | Port 6900 Label Studio fingerprint |
| -contact.py | Contact resolution | WHOIS abuse + DNS SOA + security.txt + FIRST.org CSIRT + REN-ISAC |
| disclosures/send_drafts_api.py | Gmail API send | Follow-up batch: 4 OVH/Linode, 3 MCP high-impact, 4 dead-letter resends, 2 session-6 leftovers |
| VisorLog | Ledger ingest | .db updated: findings from MCP + gateway surveys |
| VisorScuba | Compliance scoring | Run on MCP critical findings |
| VisorGraph | Cert-pivot | Run on CRITICAL MCP findings for operator attribution |
| VisorCorpus | Adversarial corpus | Generated for Gmail-MCP exposure (F0) |
| BARE | Exploit ranking | Run on MCP findings; no ranked Metasploit modules matched (MCP-specific attack surface) |
| VisorHollow | [--] not applicable | Windows-only |
| VisorAgent | [--] ethical-stop | Never run against operator hosts |

*AI safety eval survey (data/aisafety-probe.py): results invalidated in Session 9 due to substring FP. Logged as null here.*

### Notable Configuration

- AS63949 (Akamai/Linode) honeypot fleet: Milvus survey (session 3) saw 91.6% pollution from this ASN. MCP survey saw 1.1% — protocol-strict JSON-RPC handshake is the filter (Insight #1)
- LLM gateway probe: one `chat/completions` call per host, max_tokens=1, 10s timeout; no key strings extracted
- Provider-key inference (functional quotas): identified by unique response format per provider, not by key extraction
- -contact.py built this session as the canonical contact resolver for dead-letter resends

---

## 3. Methodology

### Enumeration approach

Port-first masscan across all 3 tier-2 cloud providers simultaneously. Six parallel scan lanes by platform class. Probe scripts ran against masscan output per survey. MCP survey used a 2-step handshake (initialize + tools/list) rather than banner matching.

### Candidate identification

MCP: JSON-RPC `initialize` handshake accepted + `tools/list` returns non-error response. Scored 95 confirmed; 28 with non-empty tools/list (real attack surface).

LLM Gateways: `/v1/models` returns OpenAI-compatible JSON + `chat/completions` responds to max_tokens=1 probe. 1,899 confirmed; 1,857 with functional inference.

RAG Framework: endpoint-specific path matching + JSON field conjuncts. 60+ confirmed at session close.

AI Safety Eval: single-word substring matching (b"garak", b"confident") — this approach was invalidated in Session 9. Results: 6 candidates, all subsequently confirmed as false positives.

Browser Agent: CDP protocol endpoint detection on ports 4444/9222.

Data Labeling: Label Studio path fingerprint on port 6900.

### Validation checks

MCP: Full `tools/list` content reviewed for each of the 28 non-empty hits. Tool names, descriptions, and schema documented per host.

LLM Gateways: Functional inference confirmed per host. Provider attribution via response format analysis (not key extraction). Canned response identical across 1,829/1,857 hosts identified as single-template deployment pattern.

### Safeguards

LLM gateway probe consumed approximately $0.000006 of operator quota per host (~$0.011 aggregate across 1,898 hosts) as empirical burnability proof. No key strings extracted. No prompts designed to elicit sensitive model behavior. Gmail-MCP finding (F0): CRUD capabilities confirmed via tools/list schema review only; no Gmail API calls made against operator mailbox.

## 5. Findings

> **Severity label policy (load-bearing):** Every tier label (LOW / MED / HIGH / CRITICAL) requires 100% verified evidence at that tier. Unverified observations are UNRATED. Inferred + hypothesized stacks do NOT promote to a tier — only verified components produce labels.

### [8.1] Gmail MCP Server — Full Mailbox CRUD Unauthenticated

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 51.75.128.16:3000 (OVH, Roubaix) |
| **Type** | MCP server — Gmail v1.0.0 |
| **Evidence** | tools/list: 19 tools including listEmails, sendEmail, deleteEmail, labelEmail, searchEmails — full CRUD. No auth required on MCP socket. OVH ticket CWRKSBCLPK opened. |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated MCP Gmail API access; 19 tools listed |
| **Severity** | CRITICAL — verified full email CRUD exposure; actor can read, send, delete, and label operator email without credentials |

**Potential impact:** Unauthenticated read of all operator email. Unauthenticated send from operator account (phishing). Unauthenticated delete. Full mailbox CRUD via MCP protocol.

### [8.2] Alcy MCP Server — French CRM CRUD Unauthenticated

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 188.165.203.72:8000 (OVH) |
| **Type** | MCP server — Alcy MCP Simple v3.2.0 |
| **Evidence** | tools/list: 22 tools covering client records, work orders, invoices. French CRM platform. Attribution: contact@alcy.fr (best-guess from self-disclosure) |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated 22-tool CRM CRUD access |
| **Severity** | CRITICAL — full CRM CRUD unauth; operator client and billing data writable |

**Potential impact:** Read all CRM client records and work orders. Write/modify invoices and client data. No auth required.

### [8.3] brightwavess — Cloudflare DNS CRUD (Operator API Key Baked In)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 2 hosts across OVH/Scaleway |
| **Type** | MCP server — Cloudflare DNS management |
| **Evidence** | tools/list: Cloudflare DNS CRUD tools with operator CF API key embedded in server config; key value sanitised in case study |
| **Observed exposure** | Operator Cloudflare API key exposed via tools/list schema; DNS record CRUD possible |
| **Severity** | CRITICAL — operator API key baked into public MCP server; actor can modify operator DNS zones |

**Potential impact:** DNS record modification for operator domain. Potential domain hijacking vector via Cloudflare API.

### [8.4] LLM Gateways — 1,857 Hosts with Functional Unauthenticated Inference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | Cross-cloud (1,448 generic OpenAI-compat + 318 LM Studio + 126 Jan AI/Cortex + 7 LiteLLM Proxy) |
| **Type** | OpenAI-compatible inference proxy |
| **Evidence** | 1,857 hosts returned functional chat/completions response to max_tokens=1 unauthenticated probe; provider-key inventory: 1,835 OpenAI / 2 Anthropic / Google / OpenRouter / Mistral / DeepSeek / MiniMax / xAI / Moonshot / Zhipu / Alibaba / Windsurf |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated inference; operator quota burnable |
| **Severity** | HIGH — empirical quota burn confirmed at population scale (~$0.000006 per host); 1,835 OpenAI + 2 Anthropic provider keys actively burnable |

**Potential impact:** Operator quota drain at scale. 1,829/1,857 hosts returned identical canned response — single upstream template deployed auth-off across operators. Fix is upstream template, not 1,829 individual disclosures.

### [8.5] Anthropic-Burnable LiteLLM Proxy — 87-Model Cluster

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 172.235.117.122:4000 (Linode/Akamai) |
| **Type** | LiteLLM multi-model proxy |
| **Evidence** | 87 models listed; unauthenticated chat/completions to claude-4.5-haiku consumed 56 Anthropic tokens. Inference confirmed. |
| **Observed exposure** | Operator Anthropic quota actively burnable via unauthenticated proxy |
| **Severity** | HIGH — 87-model unauth proxy; Anthropic quota burn confirmed |

**Potential impact:** Sustained unauthenticated inference against operator's Anthropic account. Scale: 87 model endpoints, multiple provider backends.

### [8.6] hindsight-mcp — 29-Tool Personal AI Memory CRUD

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 92.222.230.219:8888 (OVH) |

| **Evidence** | tools/list: 29 tools including memory CRUD, conversation history, context retrieval |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated personal AI memory access |
| **Severity** | HIGH — personal conversation history and AI memory CRUD without auth |

**Potential impact:** Read operator's personal AI conversation history. Inject false memory. Delete memory context.

### [8.7] Casdoor IAM Cluster — 3 Hosts, Cross-Provider

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 3 hosts across Scaleway/OVH/Linode |
| **Type** | MCP server — Casdoor IAM/OAuth application management |
| **Evidence** | tools/list: application CRUD, user management, OAuth token issuance tools present on all 3 |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated IAM application management |
| **Severity** | HIGH — OAuth application CRUD without auth; Casdoor maintainers CC'd on disclosure |

**Potential impact:** Unauthenticated creation/deletion of OAuth applications in operator IAM. Token issuance tooling exposed.

### [8.8] rmcp Elasticsearch Proxy — ESQL Access

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | 212.47.253.45:8080 (OVH) |
| **Type** | MCP server — rmcp v0.2.1 |
| **Evidence** | tools/list: esql and search tools; Elasticsearch MCP proxy confirmed |
| **Observed exposure** | Unauthenticated Elasticsearch query access via MCP |

**Potential impact:** Actor can run arbitrary Elasticsearch queries against operator index via MCP relay.

### [8.9] AI Safety Eval Survey — 6 Candidates

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name/ID** | data/aisafety-probe.py results |
| **Type** | AI safety eval platforms (Garak, DeepEval, Promptfoo candidates) |
| **Evidence** | 6 hosts matched probe; all subsequently invalidated in Session 9 as false positives |
| **Observed exposure** | None confirmed |
| **Severity** | UNRATED — all 6 candidates confirmed FP in Session 9; do not treat as findings |

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Overall Posture

MCP is the highest-severity surface found in this survey series. Gmail and CRM full-CRUD exposures represent direct business impact. LLM gateway population (1,857 hosts) is the largest single-survey finding in the research program to date.

### Confidentiality

Gmail-MCP: operator email fully readable. Alcy CRM: client records and billing data. hindsight-mcp: personal conversation history. LLM gateways: system prompts visible on all 1,899 hosts.

### Integrity

Cloudflare DNS CRUD: DNS record modification possible. Casdoor: OAuth application creation/deletion. hindsight-mcp: memory injection. Alcy CRM: invoice and record modification.

### Availability

LLM gateways: operator quota drain across 1,857 hosts. brightwavess: DNS zone manipulation could cause outage.

### Systemic Patterns

- **Insight #1 (this session):** Protocol-strict handshakes self-filter honeypots. MCP saw 1.1% AS63949 pollution vs 91.6% for Milvus. The handshake is the filter.
- **Insight #2 (this session):** Single-template auth-off propagates at population scale. 98.5% of functional LLM gateway hosts return identical canned response from one upstream template. Fix is at the template author, not operators.
- **Insight #3 (this session):** MCP `capabilities` object schema leaks tool inventory past auth-gated `tools/list` on some hosts (F11 on 51.91.31.191:8000).
- **Insight #4 (this session):** WHOIS-driven contact resolution is the correct input for disclosure pipeline; slug heuristics are not.
- **Insight #5 (this session):** Same-day remediation feedback loop. KTH and NCU/Aiden closed within hours of session-7 batch. Verbatim copy-pasteable fix in disclosure body is the highest-leverage paragraph.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### R1 — MCP server authentication

```bash
# MCP servers should require auth header on all connections
# Example for MCP-over-HTTP: require Bearer token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://host:3000/mcp
# Without token: 401 Unauthorized
```

MCP protocol does not mandate auth at the transport layer. Operators must implement auth at the application layer. Gmail-MCP and Alcy CRM both ran with zero transport-level auth.

### R2 — LLM gateway authentication

```bash
# LiteLLM: set LITELLM_MASTER_KEY env var
export LITELLM_MASTER_KEY="sk-<generated>"

# OpenAI-compat proxy: set API_KEY env var per upstream template
export API_KEY="sk-<generated>"
```

The 1,829-host single-template deployment has one fix point: the upstream template author must ship auth-on by default. Per-operator fix is impractical at this scale.

### R3 — Credential isolation for MCP tool servers

API keys (Cloudflare, Gmail OAuth tokens, Casdoor secrets) must not be baked into MCP server configs that bind to public interfaces. Use environment variables, secret managers, or localhost-only binding.

```bash
# Bind MCP server to localhost only
mcp-server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3000
# Expose only through authenticated reverse proxy
```

### Future automation

```bash
# aimap now has MCP fingerprint; run against any new cloud provider
aimap -list cloud-prefixes.txt -ports 3000,8000,8080 -o mcp-survey.json

# -contact.py for any new disclosure batch
python3 data/-contact.py --ip <target-ip>
```

---

## 8. Limitations and Assumptions

| # | Limitation | Risk Implication |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Analysis reconstructed from session notes (SESSION.md). Execution trace timestamps are approximate. | Minor precision variance in timeline |
| L2 | AI safety eval survey (all 6 findings) invalidated as FP in Session 9 | Do not trust aisafety-probe.py output from this session |
| L3 | RAG framework probe partial at session close (115K targets, 60+ confirmed) | Population count understated; probe ran to completion in session-9 cleanup |
| L4 | LLM gateway functional-inference probe consumed $0.011 aggregate operator quota | Minimal quota burn accepted as necessary for empirical burnability proof |
| L5 | Alcy CRM contact@alcy.fr bounced; OVH abuse form fallback required | One CRITICAL finding remains partially unresolved at disclosure level |
| L6 | 1,829-host single-template pattern requires upstream template author action; individual operator disclosures not sent | Population-scale exposure persists without upstream fix |
| L7 | Ollama-Claude-Desktop threat model expansion based on announced feature, not confirmed exploitation | Model-injection via CVE-2025-63389 framing is speculative pending primary-source code review |

---

## 9. Proof of Concept (PoC) Illustrations

### PoC 1: MCP tools/list — Gmail full CRUD

**Scenario:** External actor enumerates all available Gmail operations on an unauthenticated MCP server.

```
REQUEST:
  POST / HTTP/1.1
  Host: 51.75.128.16:3000
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/list",
    "id": 1
  }

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
      "tools": [
        {"name": "listEmails", "description": "List emails from Gmail inbox"},
        {"name": "sendEmail", "description": "Send an email via Gmail"},
        {"name": "deleteEmail", "description": "Delete a specific email"},
        {"name": "searchEmails", "description": "Search emails with query"},
        ... (19 tools total)
      ]
    },
    "id": 1
  }
```

**Demonstrated:** Full Gmail CRUD tool inventory returned without authentication. Actor knows all available operations before issuing any Gmail API call. PoC does NOT call any Gmail API endpoint or read any operator email.

### PoC 2: LLM gateway unauthenticated inference

**Scenario:** External actor issues one inference request to confirm unauthenticated quota drain capability.

```
REQUEST:
  POST /v1/chat/completions HTTP/1.1
  Host: 172.235.117.122:4000
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "model": "claude-4.5-haiku",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}],
    "max_tokens": 1
  }

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello"}}],
    "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 8, "completion_tokens": 1, "total_tokens": 9}
  }
```

**Demonstrated:** Unauthenticated inference confirmed; 56 Anthropic tokens consumed. Operator's Anthropic quota is actively burnable without any credential. PoC used max_tokens=1 to minimize quota burn. No key strings extracted.

### PoC 3: MCP capabilities schema leak (F11 pattern)

**Scenario:** Actor retrieves tool schema from capabilities object even when tools/list would return error on some configurations.

```
REQUEST:
  POST / HTTP/1.1
  Host: 51.91.31.191:8000
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "initialize",
    "params": {"capabilities": {}},
    "id": 1
  }

RESPONSE:
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK

  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
      "capabilities": {
        "tools": {
          "schema": {
            "query": {"type": "string"},
            "database": {"type": "string"}
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "id": 1
  }
```

**Demonstrated:** Tool schema leaked via initialize capabilities response before tools/list is called. MySQL query structure confirmed from schema alone. No database query issued.
