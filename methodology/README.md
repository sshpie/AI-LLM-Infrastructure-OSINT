# Methodology Insights

Standalone permalink-able findings about *how to do AI-infrastructure OSINT at scale*. Each insight comes from a specific survey or incident in the [case studies](../case-studies/) and is captured here so it can be cited independently of the survey that produced it.

The full inline list lives in [`SYNTHESIS-2026-05.md`](../case-studies/commercial/SYNTHESIS-2026-05.md). This directory is the per-insight permalink layer.

## Reference documents (non-insight)

Methodology artifacts in this directory that are not numbered insights:

- [`tool-stage-mapping.md`](tool-stage-mapping.md) — which arsenal tool runs at which of the 8 pipeline stages, the executable `visor-chain-runner.sh` order, the orchestration layer (VisorPlus / osint-platoon), and off-linear/special-status tools. Reconciles the website `/tools`, the chain runner, and `METHODOLOGY.md` into one map.
- [`gov-critinfra-playbook.md`](gov-critinfra-playbook.md) — government / critical-infrastructure handling.
- [`embedding-services-survey-runbook.md`](embedding-services-survey-runbook.md) — embedding-tier survey runbook.

## How these insights are produced

Each insight is the result of a *meta-finding* during a normal survey or incident response, a moment where the methodology itself failed, partially succeeded, or surfaced a generalizable pattern. The discipline is to capture them in the moment rather than treat them as one-off bug fixes.

When an insight is added, it lives both in the inline list of `SYNTHESIS-2026-05.md` (as a numbered paragraph) and as a standalone file here (with frontmatter linking back to the originating case/disclosure).

## Recurring shapes

Several of these insights are instances of broader patterns:

- **Substring-matcher false positives**, Insights #6 and #7 are the same class at different layers (probe-side vs seed-side).
- **Vendor-template root cause**, Insights #2 and #10 are the same root-cause class at different layers (cloud reseller proxy vs embedded research instrument). Both produce population-scale exposure that operator hardening cannot fix.
- **Probe must follow protocol depth**, Insights #3 and #8 both surface auth-gated information at handshake/redirect-following layers that entry-point-only probes miss.
- **Primary-source verification beats framing**, Insights #4, #10, and #11 all show that intake notes / bug reports / pipeline heuristics frame the actor incorrectly until the actor's own primary record (WHOIS, vendor systemd unit, source code) is consulted directly.
