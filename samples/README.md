# Samples

Public malware samples submitted by  to industry sample-sharing platforms (MalwareBazaar + VirusTotal). Reporter handle on submissions: ``.

This directory is the index layer. Each sample has a standalone permalink page with full IOCs, attribution context, and links to the originating incident case study.

## Public availability policy

 submits novel samples to public sample-sharing platforms after:

1. **Confirming novelty**, the sample is not already in VirusTotal, MalwareBazaar, AlienVault OTX, or GitHub-indexed code.
2. **Verifying it's malware**, not legitimate operator software (admin panels, AI agent state files, vendor management tools).
3. **Coordinating disclosure**, relevant abuse contacts and victim CERTs have been notified, so AV/EDR detection lands roughly in sync with vendor remediation channels.

Live malware binaries are **not** committed to this repo (GitHub AUP), but the hashes, IOCs, and public-platform URLs are.
